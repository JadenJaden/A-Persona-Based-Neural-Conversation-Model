monica| there's nothing to tell! he's just some guy i work with!|joey| c'mon, you're going out with the guy! there's gotta be something wrong with him!
chandler| all right joey, be nice. so does he have a hump? a hump and a hairpiece?|phoebe| wait, does he eat chalk?
phoebe| just, 'cause, i don't want her to go through what i went through with carl- oh!|monica| okay, everybody relax. this is not even a date. it's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
chandler| sounds like a date to me.|chandler| alright, so i'm back in high school, i'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and i realize i am totally naked.
all| oh, yeah. had that dream.|chandler| then i look down, and i realize there's a phone... there.
joey| instead of...?|chandler| that's right.
joey| never had that dream.|phoebe| no.
chandler| all of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. now i don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. |monica| and they weren't looking at you before?!
chandler| finally, i figure i'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!|ross|  hi.
joey| this guy says hello, i wanna kill myself.|monica| are you okay, sweetie?
ross| i just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...|chandler| cookie?
monica|  carol moved her stuff out today. |joey| ohh.
monica|  let me get you some coffee.|ross| thanks.
phoebe| ooh! oh! |ross| no, no don't! stop cleansing my aura! no, just leave my aura alone, okay?
phoebe| fine! be murky!|ross| i'll be fine, alright? really, everyone. i hope she'll be very happy.
monica| no you don't.|ross| no i don't, to hell with her, she left me!
joey| and you never knew she was a lesbian...|ross| no!! okay?! why does everyone keep fixating on that? she didn't know, how should i know?
chandler| sometimes i wish i was a lesbian...  did i say that out loud?|ross| i told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
monica| oh really, so that hysterical phone call i got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 a.m., \i'll never have grandchildren, i'll never have grandchildren.\ was what? a wrong number?|ross| sorry.
joey| alright ross, look. you're feeling a lot of pain right now. you're angry. you're hurting. can i tell you what the answer is?|joey| strip joint! c'mon, you're single! have some hormones!
ross| i don't want to be single, okay? i just... i just- i just wanna be married again!|chandler| and i just want a million dollars! 
monica| rachel?!|rachel| oh god monica hi! thank god! i just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
waitress| can i get you some coffee?|monica|  this is everybody, this is chandler, and phoebe, and joey, and- you remember my brother ross? 
rachel| hi, sure!|ross| hi. 
monica| so you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?|rachel| oh god... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. i was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and i was looking at this gravy boat. this really gorgeous lamauge gravy boat. when all of a sudden-  so anyway i just didn't know where to go, and i know that you and i have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person i knew who lived here in the city.
monica| who wasn't invited to the wedding.|rachel| ooh, i was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue... 
monica| now i'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. |chandler|  tuna or egg salad? decide!
ross|  i'll have whatever christine is having.|rachel|  daddy, i just... i can't marry him! i'm sorry. i just don't love him. well, it matters to me! 
phoebe| if i let go of my hair, my head will fall off. |chandler|  ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. 
joey| i say push her down the stairs. |rachel| c'mon daddy, listen to me! it's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you're a shoe! you're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i don't wanna be a shoe? what if i wanna be a- a purse, y'know? or a- or a hat! no, i'm not saying i want you to buy me a hat, i'm saying i am a ha- it's a metaphor, daddy!
ross| you can see where he'd have trouble.|rachel| look daddy, it's my life. well maybe i'll just stay here with monica. 
monica| well, i guess we've established who's staying here with monica...|rachel| well, maybe that's my decision. well, maybe i don't need your money. wait!! wait, i said maybe!!
monica| just breathe, breathe.. that's it. just try to think of nice calm things...|phoebe|  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... la la la la...something and noodles with string. these are a few...
rachel| i'm all better now.|phoebe|  i helped!
monica| okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? independence. taking control of your life. the whole, 'hat' thing.|joey|  and hey, you need anything, you can always come to joey. me and chandler live across the hall. and he's away a lot.
monica| joey, stop hitting on her! it's her wedding day!|joey| what, like there's a rule or something?
chandler| please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.|paul|  it's, uh, it's paul.
monica| oh god, is it 6:30? buzz him in!|joey| who's paul?
ross| paul the wine guy, paul?|monica| maybe. joey: wait. your 'not a real date' tonight is with paul the wine guy?
ross| he finally asked you out?|monica| yes!
chandler| ooh, this is a dear diary moment.|monica| rach, wait, i can cancel...
rachel| please, no, go, that'd be fine!|monica|  are, are you okay? i mean, do you want me to stay?
ross|  that'd be good...|monica|  really?
ross|  no, go on! it's paul the wine guy!|phoebe| what does that mean?  does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? 
monica| hi, come in! paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is paul.|all| hey! paul! hi! the wine guy! hey!
chandler| i'm sorry, i didn't catch your name. paul, was it?|monica| okay, umm-umm, i'll just--i'll be right back, i just gotta go ah, go ah...
ross| a wandering?|monica| change! okay, sit down.  two seconds.
phoebe| ooh, i just pulled out four eyelashes. that can't be good.|joey| hey, paul!
paul| yeah?|joey| here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
monica|  shut up, joey!|ross| so rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
rachel| well, i was kinda supposed to be headed for aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!|ross| right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, god.. no, no, although, aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, joey and chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
chandler|  yes, and we're very excited about it. |rachel| well actually thanks, but i think i'm just gonna hang out here tonight. it's been kinda a long day.
ross| okay, sure.|joey| hey pheebs, you wanna help?
phoebe| oh, i wish i could, but i don't want to.|phoebe|  la-la-la-la...ohhh!
ross|  i'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. i have no brackety thing, i see no whim guys whatsoever and- i cannot feel my legs.|joey| i'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
chandler| it's a beautiful thing.|joey|  what's this?
chandler| i would have to say that is an 'l'-shaped bracket.|joey| which goes where?
chandler| i have no idea.|joey| done with the bookcase!
chandler| all finished!|ross|  this was carol's favorite beer. she always drank it out of the can, i should have known.
joey| hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.|chandler| yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
joey| ross, let me ask you a question. she got the furniture, the stereo, the good tv- what did you get?|ross| you guys.
chandler| oh, god.|joey| you got screwed.
chandler| oh my god!|monica| oh my god!
paul| i know, i know, i'm such an idiot. i guess i should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. i mean, how clean can teeth get?|monica| my brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. how did you get through it?
paul| well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-|monica| -leg?
paul|  that's one way! me, i- i went for the watch.|monica| you actually broke her watch? wow! the worst thing i ever did was, i-i shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
paul| ooh, steer clear of you.|monica| that's right. 
rachel| barry, i'm sorry... i am so sorry... i know you probably think that this is all about what i said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and i ju- |ross| i'm divorced! i'm only 26 and i'm divorced!
joey| shut up!|chandler| you must stop! 
ross| that only took me an hour.|chandler| look, ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento.  you, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! i don't think that was my point!
ross| you know what the scariest part is? what if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? i mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...|joey| what are you talking about? 'one woman'? that's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. lemme tell you something, ross. there's lots of flavors out there. there's rocky road, and cookie dough, and bing! cherry vanilla. you could get 'em with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! this is the best thing that ever happened to you! you got married, you were, like, what, eight? welcome back to the world! grab a spoon!
ross| i honestly don't know if i'm hungry or horny.|chandler| stay out of my freezer! 
paul| ever since she walked out on me, i, uh...|monica| what?..... what, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
paul| no, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.|monica| oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
paul| isn't there?|monica| yeah... yeah, i think there is. -what were you gonna say?
paul| well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, i haven't been able to, uh, perform.  ...sexually. |monica|  oh god, oh god, i am sorry... i am so sorry...
paul| it's okay...|monica| i know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. um... how long?
paul| two years.|monica| wow! i'm-i'm-i'm glad you smashed her watch! 
paul| so you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?|monica| ...yeah. yeah, i do.
priest on tv| we are gathered here today to join joanne louise cunningham and charles, chachi-chachi-chachi, arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.|rachel| oh...see... but joanne loved chachi! that's the difference!
ross|  grab a spoon. do you know how long it's been since i've grabbed a spoon? do the words 'billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? |joey| great story! but, i uh, i gotta go, i got a date with andrea--angela--andrea... oh man, 
chandler| angela's the screamer, andrea has cats.|joey| right. thanks. it's june. i'm outta here. 
ross| y'know, here's the thing. even if i could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am i gonna ask? |rachel| isn't this amazing? i mean, i have never made coffee before in my entire life.
chandler| that is amazing.|joey| congratulations. 
rachel| y'know, i figure if i can make coffee, there isn't anything i can't do.|chandler| if can invade poland, there isn't anything i can't do.
joey| listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a western omelet or something...  although actually i'm really not that hungry...|monica|  oh good, lenny and squigy are here.
all| morning. good morning.|paul|  morning.
joey| morning, paul.|rachel| hello, paul.
chandler| hi, paul, is it?|paul| thank you! thank you so much!
monica| stop!|paul| no, i'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in witness.
monica| we'll talk later.|paul| yeah. 
joey| that wasn't a real date?! what the hell do you do on a real date?|monica| shut up, and put my table back.
all| okayyy! |chandler| all right, kids, i gotta get to work. if i don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... 
rachel| so, like, you guys all have jobs?|monica| yeah, we all have jobs. see, that's how we buy stuff.
joey| yeah, i'm an actor.|rachel| wow! would i have seen you in anything?
joey| i doubt it. mostly regional work.|monica| oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the reruns' production of pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
joey| look, it was a job all right?|chandler| 'look, gippetto, i'm a real live boy.'
joey| i will not take this abuse. |chandler| you're right, i'm sorry.  \once i was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...\
joey| you should both know, that he's a dead man. oh, chandler?  |monica| so how you doing today? did you sleep okay? talk to barry? i can't stop smiling.
rachel| i can see that. you look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.|monica| i know, he's just so, so... do you remember you and tony demarco?
rachel| oh, yeah.|monica| well, it's like that. with feelings.
rachel| oh wow. are you in trouble.|monica| big time!
rachel| want a wedding dress?  hardly used.|monica| i think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. okay. okay. i am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. or else i'm just gonna get up and go to work.
rachel| oh, look, wish me luck!|monica| what for?
rachel| i'm gonna go get one of those  job things.|frannie| hey, monica! 
monica| hey frannie, welcome back! how was florida? |frannie| you had sex, didn't you? 
monica| how do you do that?|frannie| oh, i hate you, i'm pushing my aunt roz through parrot jungle and you're having sex! so? who? 
monica| you know paul? |frannie| paul the wine guy? oh yeah, i know paul. 
monica| you mean you know paul like i know paul? |frannie| are you kidding? i take credit for paul. y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years. 
joey| of course it was a line! |monica| why?! why? why, why would anybody do something like that? 
ross| i assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'. |monica| i hate men! i hate men!
phoebe| oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.|monica| is it me? is it like i have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? 
phoebe| all right, c'mere, gimme your feet.  |monica| i just thought he was nice, y'know? 
joey|  i can't believe you didn't know it was a line! |rachel| guess what? 
ross| you got a job? |rachel| are you kidding? i'm trained for nothing! i was laughed out of twelve interviews today. 
chandler| and yet you're surprisingly upbeat. |rachel| you would be too if you found john and david boots on sale, fifty percent off! 
chandler| oh, how well you know me... |rachel| they're my new 'i don't need a job, i don't need my parents, i've got great boots' boots! 
monica| how'd you pay for them? |rachel| uh, credit card. 
monica| and who pays for that? |rachel| um... my... father. 
rachel| oh god, come on you guys, is this really necessary? i mean, i can stop charging anytime i want. |monica| c'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life. 
rachel| i know that. that's why i was getting married. |phoebe| give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. 
rachel| thank you. |phoebe| you're welcome. i remember when i first came to this city. i was fourteen. my mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and i got here, and i didn't know anybody. and i ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then i found aromatherapy. so believe me, i know exactly how you feel. 
ross| the word you're looking for is 'anyway'... |monica| all right, you ready?
rachel| no. no, no, i'm not ready! how can i be ready? \hey, rach! you ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\ come on, i can't do this!|monica| you can, i know you can! 
rachel| i don't think so.|ross| come on, you made coffee!  you can do anything! 
ross| c'mon, cut. cut, cut, cut,... |all| cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... 
rachel| y'know what? i think we can just leave it at that. it's kinda like a symbolic gesture...|monica| rachel! that was a library card! 
all| cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..|chandler|  y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. 
monica| welcome to the real world! it sucks. you're gonna love it! |monica| well, that's it  you gonna crash on the couch? 
ross| no. no, i gotta go home sometime. |monica| you be okay? 
ross| yeah. |rachel| hey mon, look what i just found on the floor.  what? 
monica| that's paul's watch. you just put it back where you found it. oh boy. alright. goodnight, everybody. |ross and rachel| goodnight.
ross| mmm.  oh, no- |rachel| sorry- 
ross| no no no, go- |rachel| no, you have it, really, i don't want it- 
ross| split it? |rachel| okay. 
ross| okay.  you know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, i had a, um, major crush on you. |rachel| i knew. 
ross| you did! oh.... i always figured you just thought i was monica's geeky older brother. |rachel| i did. 
ross| oh. listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if i asked you out? sometime? maybe? |rachel| yeah, maybe... 
ross| okay... okay, maybe i will... |rachel| goodnight. 
ross| goodnight. |monica| see ya.... waitwait, what's with you? 
ross| i just grabbed a spoon.  |joey| i can't believe what i'm hearing here. 
phoebe|  i can't believe what i'm hearing here... |monica| what? i-i said you had a- 
phoebe|  what i said you had... |monica|  would you stop? 
phoebe| oh, was i doing it again?|all| yes!
monica| i said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.|joey| oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
ross| there's an image. |rachel|  would anybody like more coffee? 
chandler| did you make it, or are you just serving it? |rachel| i'm just serving it. 
all| yeah. yeah, i'll have a cup of coffee. |chandler| kids, new dream... i'm in las vegas. 
customer|  ahh, miss?  more coffee? |rachel| ugh.  sorry. okay, las vegas.
joey| yeah, right!.......y'serious? |phoebe| oh, yeah! 
rachel| everything you need to know is in that first kiss. |monica| absolutely. 
chandler| yeah, i think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? i mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out. |ross| yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
chandler| the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? i mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. |rachel| yeah, well, word of advice: bring back the comedian. otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone. 
joey| ....are we still talking about sex?|ross| no, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
marsha| well, she has issues. |ross| does she. 
marsha| he's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! |ross| marsha, these are cave people. okay? they have issues like 'gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' see? 
marsha| speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? |ross|  no. no. 
marsha| yes, it is. carol! hi! |ross| okay, okay, yes, it is.  how about i'll, uh, catch up with you in the ice age. 
ross|hi. |carol| so. 
ross| you look great. i, uh... i hate that. |carol| sorry. you look good too. 
ross| ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... so what's new? still, uh... |carol| a lesbian? 
ross| well... you never know. how's, um.. how's the family? |carol| marty's still totally paranoid. oh, and, uh- 
ross| why- why are you here, carol? |carol| i'm pregnant. 
ross| pregnant?! |chandler| oh, i think this is the episode of three's company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
phoebe|...then i've already seen this one!  |monica|  are you through with that? 
joey| yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. |monica| whose little ball of paper is this?! 
chandler| oh, uh, that would be mine. see, i wrote a note to myself, and then i realised i didn't need it, so i balled it up and...  ...now i wish i was dead. |phoebe| she's already fluffed that pillow... monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine! 
monica| look , i'm sorry, guys, i just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. |chandler| yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
phoebe| monica- hi! um, monica, you're scaring me. i mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. and not-not in a good way. |joey| yeah, calm down. you don't see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
monica| that's because as far as my parents are concerned, ross can do no wrong. y'see, he's the prince. apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born. |chandler|  ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
monica| what? |chandler| ugly naked guy got a thighmaster! 
all| eeaagh! |rachel| has anybody seen my engagement ring? 
phoebe| yeah, it's beautiful. |rachel| oh god, oh god, oh god oh god oh god oh god....  
phoebe| no, look, don't touch that! |rachel| oh, like i wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'hi barry! remember me? i'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' oh god and now i'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
monica| easy rach, we'll find it.  won't we! |chandler and joey| oh! yeah!
joey| alright, when'd'ya have it on last?|phoebe| doy! probably right before she lost it! 
chandler| you don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... |rachel| i know i had it this morning, and i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with... 
chandler| ...dinah? |rachel|  ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
monica| you didn't. |rachel| oh, i am sorry... 
monica| i gave you one job!  |rachel| oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
chandler| now, monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... |monica|  i just... can't do it. 
chandler| boys? we're going in. |ross| .....hi. 
monica| wow. that is not a happy hi. |ross| carol's pregnant. 
phoebe|  ooh! i found it! |monica| w-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
ross| yeah. do that for another two hours, you might be where i am right about now.  |chandler| kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, mon? 
rachel| well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? |ross| well, carol says she and susan want me to be involved, but if i'm not comfortable with it, i don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
phoebe| she is so great! i miss her. |monica| what does she mean by 'involved'? 
chandler| i mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. |ross| anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
rachel| so what are you gonna do? |ross| i have no idea. no matter what i do, though, i'm still gonna be a father. 
joey| .....well, this is still ruined, right?|mrs. geller| oh, martha ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  mmm! what's that curry taste? 
monica| curry. |mrs. geller| mmmm! 
ross| i- i think they're great! i, i really do. |mr. geller|  do you remember the ludwins? the big one had a thing for you, didn't she? 
mrs. geller| they all had a thing for him. |ross| aw, mom... 
monica| i'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? |mrs. geller| oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... i don't know. anyway, i told her you had a restaurant- 
monica| no mom, i don't have a restaurant, i work in a restaurant. |mrs. geller| well, they don't have to know that...  
monica| ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? |ross| yeah.  
mrs. geller| oh, we're having spaghetti! that's.... easy. |monica| i know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? because i think it might take some of the heat off me. 
mrs. geller| what that rachel did to her life.... we ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well. |mr. geller| i'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money! 
mrs. geller| well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... |monica| what's that supposed to mean? 
mrs. geller| nothing! it's an expression. |monica| no it's not. 
mr. geller| don't listen to your mother. you're independent, and you always have been! even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! and you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles... |mr. geller| look, there are people like ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. other people are satisfied with staying where they are- i'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer. 
mr. geller| ...and i read about these women trying to have it all, and i thank god 'our little harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. |monica|  no news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
ross|  look, i, uh- i realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. carol's a lesbian. she's living with a woman named susan. she's pregnant with my child, and she and susan are going to raise the baby. |mrs. geller|  and you knew about this?! 
joey| your folks are really that bad, huh? |ross| well, y'know, these people are pros. they know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
monica| boy, i know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -i'd want yours. |ross| must pee.  
phoebe| y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. |rachel| you're twins? 
phoebe| yeah. we don't speak. she's like this high-powered, driven career type. |chandler| what does she do?

rachel| so, got any advice? y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? |ross| well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, i know it'll be hard. or, y'know, uh, hey!, i'll go down there, and i'll give barry back his ring, and you can go with carol and susan to the ob/gyn... 
rachel| oh, you've got carol tomorrow.. when did it get so complicated? |ross| got me.

carol| julia.. |susan| we agreed on minnie. 
ross| 's'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. things change, roll with the punches. i believe julia's on the table..? |barry| sorry about that. so. what have you been up to? 
rachel| oh, not much. i-i got a job. |barry| oh, that's great. 
rachel| why are- why are you so tanned? |barry| oh, i, uh- i went to aruba. 
rachel| oh no. you went on our honeymoon alone? |barry| no. i went with, uh.. now, this may hurt. 
robbie| me?! |barry| no!  i went with mindy. 
rachel| mindy?! my maid of honour, mindy?! |barry| yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now. 
rachel| oh! well, um..  you've got plugs! |barry| careful! they haven't quite taken yet. 
rachel| and you've got lenses! but you hate sticking your finger in your eye! |barry| not for her. listen, i really wanted to thank you. 
rachel| okay.. |barry| see, about a month ago, i wanted to hurt you. more than i've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. and i'm an orthodontist. 
rachel| wow. |barry| you know, you were right? i mean, i thought we were happy. we weren't happy. but with mindy, now i'm happy. spit. 
rachel| what? |robbie| me.  
rachel| anyway, um,  i guess this belongs to you. and thank you for giving it to me. |barry| well, thank you for giving it back. 
robbie| hello?! |susan| oh, please! what's wrong with helen? 
ross| helen geller? i don't think so. |carol| hello? it's not gonna be helen geller. 
ross| thank you! |carol| no, i mean it's not geller. 
ross| what, it's gonna be helen willick? |carol| no, actually, um, we talked about helen willick-bunch. 
ross| well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? |susan| it's my baby too. 
ross| oh, 's'funny, really? um, i don't remember you making any sperm. |susan| yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is! 
carol| all right, you two, stop it! |ross| no no no, she gets a credit, hey, i'm in there too. 
carol| ross. you're not actually suggesting helen willick-bunch-geller? 'cause i think that borders on child abuse. |ross| of course not, i'm... suggesting geller-willick-bunch. 
susan| oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? he knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her geller, then he gets his way! |ross| my way?! you-you think this is my way? believe me, of all the ways i ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? uh, um, this is too hard. i'm not, i can't do- 
dr. oberman|  knock knock!how are we today? any nausea? |all| yeah. yeah. a little. 
dr. oberman| well, i was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing.  uh, lie back.. |ross| you- uh- y'know what, i'm gonna go. i don't- i don't think i can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
ross| oh my god. |susan| look at that. 
carol| i know. |ross| well? isn't that amazing? 
joey| what are we supposed to be seeing here? |chandler| i dunno, but.. i think it's about to attack the enterprise. 
phoebe| you know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. |ross| then don't do that, alright? 
phoebe| okay! |ross| monica. whaddya think? 
monica|  mm-hmm. |ross| wh- are you welling up? 
monica| no. |ross| you are, you're welling up. 
monica| am not! |ross| you're gonna be an aunt. 
monica|  oh shut up! |rachel|  okay, i know it was a cheap shot, but i feel so much better now. 
phoebe|  hi guys! |all| hey, pheebs! hi! 
ross| hey. oh, oh, how'd it go? |phoebe| um, not so good. he walked me to the subway and said 'we should do this again!' 
all| ohh. ouch. |rachel| what? he said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? 
monica| uh, no. loosely translated 'we should do this again' means 'you will never see me naked'. |rachel| since when? 
joey| since always. it's like dating language. y'know, like 'it's not you' means 'it is you'. |chandler| or 'you're such a nice guy' means 'i'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. 
phoebe| or, or, y'know, um, 'i think we should see other people' means 'ha, ha, i already am'. |rachel| and everybody knows this? 
joey| yeah. cushions the blow. |chandler| yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. 
ross| that's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. |monica| uh, ross. 
ross| what? wh- hello? the millners' farm in connecticut? the millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....oh my god, chi chi! |chandler| \so how does it feel knowing you're about to die?\ 
joey| \warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. but you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.\ |chandler| hey, that was really good! 
joey| thanks! let's keep going. |chandler| okay. \so. whaddya want from me, damone, huh?\ 
joey| \i just wanna go back to my cell. 'cause in my cell, i can smoke.\ |chandler| \smoke away.\ 
chandler| i think this is probably why damone smokes in his cell alone. |joey| what? 
chandler| relax your hand! |chandler| not so much! 
joey| whoah! |chandler| hey! 
joey| hey! |chandler| alright, now try taking a puff. 
chandler| alright.. okay. no. give it to me. |joey| no no no, i am not giving you a cigarette. 
chandler| it's fine, it's fine. look, do you wanna get this part, or not? here. |chandler| don't think of it as a cigarette. think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. when you're holding it, you feel right. you feel complete. 
joey| y'miss it? |chandler| nah, not so much. alright, now we smoke.  
monica| no, no, no. they say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger. |joey| that's ridiculous! 
ross| can i use.. either thumb? |rachel|  decaf cappucino for joey.. coffee black.. late.. and an iced tea. i'm getting pretty good at this! 
all| yeah. yeah, excellent. |rachel|  good for me! 
joey| y'okay, phoebe? |phoebe| yeah- no- i'm just- it's, i haven't worked- it's my bank. 
monica| what did they do to you? |phoebe| it's nothing, it's just- okay. i'm going through my mail, and i open up their monthly, you know, statement- 
ross| easy. |phoebe| - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 
chandler| oh, satan's minions at work again... |phoebe| yes, 'cause now i have to go down there, and deal with them. 
joey| what are you talking about? keep it! |phoebe| it's not mine, i didn't earn it, if i kept it, it would be like stealing. 
rachel| yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! |phoebe| okay. okay, let's say i bought a really great pair of shoes. do you know what i'd hear, with every step i took? 'not-mine. not-mine. not-mine.' and even if i was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'... 
monica| we're with you. we got it. |phoebe| okay. i'd- just- i'd never be able to enjoy it. it would be like this giant karmic debt. 
rachel| chandler, what are you doing? |monica|  hey. whaddya doing? 
all| oh! oh, god! |ross| what is this?! 
chandler| i'm smoking. i'm smoking, i'm smoking. |phoebe| oh, i can't believe you! you've been so good, for three years! 
chandler| and this- is my reward! |ross| hold on a second, alright? just think about what you went through the last time you quit. 
chandler| okay, so this time i won't quit! |all| ohhh! put it out! 
chandler| all right! i'm putting it out, i'm putting it out.  |phoebe| oh, no! i- i can't drink this now! 
monica| alright. i'm gonna go change, i've got a date. |rachel| this alan again? how's it goin'? 
monica| 's'going pretty good, y'know? it's nice, and, we're having fun. |joey| so when do we get to meet the guy? 
monica| let's see, today's monday... never. |all| oh, come on! come on! 
monica| no. not after what happened with steve. |chandler| what are you talking about? we love schhteve! schhteve was schhexy!.. sorry. 
monica| look, i don't even know how i feel about him yet. just give me a chance to figure that out. |rachel| well, then can we meet him? 
monica| nope. schhorry. |monica| i mean, why should i let them meet him? i mean, i bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. i mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd. 
paula| listen. as someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, i'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. i mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you. |monica| i know. i just wish that once, i'd bring a guy home that they actually liked. 
paula| well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.. |joey| let it go, ross. 
ross| yeah, well, you didn't know chi chi. |monica| do you all promise? 
all| yeah! we promise! we'll be good! |monica|  chandler? do you promise to be good? 
joey| you can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! |ross| hey, pheebs. 
phoebe| 'dear ms. buffay. thank you for calling attention to our error. we have credited your account with five hundred dollars. we're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -football phone as our free gift.' do you believe this?! now i have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! |rachel| what bank is this? 
monica| hey. it's him.  who is it? |alan|  it's alan. 
joey|  chandler! he's here! |monica|  okay, please be good, please. just remember how much you all like me. 
monica| hi. alan, this is everybody. everybody, this is alan. |alan| hi. 
all| hi, alan. |alan| i've heard schho much about all you guyschh! 
monica|  okay. okay, let's let the alan-bashing begin. who's gonna take the first shot, hmm? |monica| c'mon! 
ross| ...i'll go. let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, i'm sorry, i can't do this, can't do this. we loved him. |all| loved him! yeah! he's great! 
monica| wait a minute! we're talking about someone that i'm going out with? |all| yeah! 
rachel| and did you notice...?  |the guys|  yeah. 
joey| know what was great? the way his smile was kinda crooked. |phoebe| yes, yes! like the man in the shoe! 
ross| ...what shoe? |phoebe| from the nursery rhyme. 'there was a crooked man, who had a crooked smile, who lived in a shoe, for a... while...' 
ross| ...so i think alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured. |rachel| what future boyfriends? nono, i th- i think this could be, y'know, it. 
monica| really! |chandler| oh, yeah. i'd marry him just for his david hasselhof impression alone. you know i'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?  
ross| you know what i like most about him, though? |all| what? 
ross| the way he makes me feel about myself. |all| yeah... 
monica| hi.. how was the game? |ross| well.. 
all| we won!! thank you! yes! |monica| fantastic! i have one question: how is that possible? 
joey| alan. |ross| he was unbelievable. he was like that-that-that bugs bunny cartoon where bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of bugs it was first base-alan, second base-alan, third base-... 
rachel| i mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. |chandler| yep, we sure showed those hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. 
monica| can i ask you guys a question? d'you ever think that alan is maybe.. sometimes.. |ross| what? 
monica| ..i dunno, a little too alan? |rachel| well, no. that's impossible. you can never be too alan. 
ross| yeah, it's his, uh, innate alan-ness that-that-that we adore. |chandler| i personally could have a gallon of alan. 
phoebe| hey, lizzie. |lizzie| hey, weird girl. 
phoebe| i brought you alphabet soup. |lizzie| did you pick out the vowels? 
phoebe| yes. but i left in the ys. 'cause, y'know, \sometimes y\. uh, i also have something else for you.  |lizzie| saltines? 
phoebe| no, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? |lizzie| what?  oh my god, there's really money in here. 
phoebe| i know. |lizzie| weird girl, what are you doing? 
phoebe| no, i want you to have it. i don't want it. |lizzie| no, no, i ha-i have to give you something. 
phoebe| oh, that's fine, no. |lizzie| would you like my tin-foil hat? 
phoebe| no. 'cause you need that. no, it's okay, thanks. |lizzie| please, let me do something. 
phoebe| okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. okay? |lizzie| okay. 
phoebe| okay. |lizzie| keep the change.  sure you don't wanna pretzel? 
phoebe| no, i'm fine. |lizzie|  see ya. 
phoebe| huh! |ross| a thumb?! 
all| eww! |phoebe| i know! i know, i opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker! 
chandler| well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? like, collect all five? |phoebe| does, um, anyone wanna see? 
all| nooo! |all| oh, hey, don't do that! cut it out! 
rachel| it's worse than the thumb! |chandler| hey, this is so unfair! 
monica| oh, why is it unfair? |chandler| so i have a flaw! big deal! like joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? and ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? and monica, with that snort when she laughs? i mean, what the hell is that thing? ...i accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this? 
joey| ...does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? |rachel| well, i-i could live without it. 
joey| well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when phoebe chews her hair? |ross| oh, now, don't listen to him, pheebs, i think it's endearing. 
joey| oh,  \you do, do you\? |ross| you know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. 
rachel| \indeed there isn't\... i should really get back to work. |phoebe| yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. 
rachel| ohh-ho-hooohhh. the hair comes out, and the gloves come on. |monica| did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? 
paula| no. |monica| okay.. well, i'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. 
paula| waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? all right, a cow got through! |monica| can you believe it? ...y'know what? i just don't feel the thing. i mean, they feel the thing, i don't feel the thing. 
paula| honey.. you should always feel the thing. listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, monica, dump him! |monica| i know.. it's gonna be really hard. 
paula| well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it. |monica| no, he'll be fine. it's the other five i'm worried about. 
joey| do you have any respect for your body? |ross| don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
chandler| hey, y'know, i have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. the bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. |rachel|  chandler? it's alan, he wants to speak to you. 
chandler| really? he does?  |rachel|  god, he's good. 
ross| if only he were a woman. |rachel| yeah. 
chandler| ooh, lambchop. how old is that sock? if i had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too. |ross| okay. i think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.  
monica|  hey. where's joey? |chandler| joey ate my last stick of gum, so i killed him. do you think that was wrong? 
rachel| i think he's across the hall. |monica| thanks.  
ross|  there y'go. |chandler|  ooh, i'm alive with pleasure now. 
ross| hey pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that pop-tart?.. pheebs? |phoebe| does anyone want the rest of this pop-tart? 
ross| hey, i might! |phoebe| sorry. ..y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb. 
all| you're kidding. oh my god. |phoebe| and on my way over here, i stepped in gum. ...what is up with the universe?! 
joey|  what's going on? |monica| nothing. i just think it's nice when we're all here together. 
joey| even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. |rachel| uh, joey.. 
joey| oh, god!  |monica|  okay.. 
all| oh! that was lambchop! |monica| please, guys, we have to talk. 
phoebe| wait, wait, i'm getting a deja vu...no, i'm not. |monica| alright, we have to talk. 
phoebe| there it is! |monica| okay. it's-it's about alan. there's something that you should know. i mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. i've decided to break up with alan. 
ross| is there somebody else? |monica| no, nononono.. it's just.. things change. people change. 
rachel| we didn't change.. |joey| so that's it? it's over? just like that? 
phoebe| you know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and i just- i-  |monica| look, i- i could go on pretending- 
joey| okay! |monica| -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to alan- it wouldn't be fair to you! 
ross| who-who wants fair? y'know, i just want things back. y'know, the way they were. |monica| i'm sorry.. 
chandler|  oh, she's sorry! i feel better! |rachel|  i just can't believe this! i mean, with the holidays coming up- i wanted him to meet my family- 
monica| i'll meet somone else. there'll be other alans. |all| oh, yeah! right! 
monica| are you guys gonna be okay? |ross| hey hey, we'll be fine. we're just gonna need a little time. 
monica|  i understand. |alan| wow. 
monica| i'm, i'm really sorry. |alan| yeah, i'm sorry too. but, i gotta tell you, i am a little relieved. 
monica| relieved? |alan| yeah, well, i had a great time with you.. i just can't stand your friends. 
rachel| remember when we went to central park and rented boats?.. that was fun. |ross| yeah. he could row like a viking. 
monica|  hi. |all| mmm. 
ross| so how'd it go? |monica| oh, y'know.. 
phoebe| did he mention us? |monica| he said he's really gonna miss you guys.  
ross| you had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.  |chandler| ...that's it. i'm getting cigarettes. 
all| no no no! |chandler|  i don't care, i don't care! game's over! i'm weak! i've gotta smoke! i've gotta have the smoke! 
phoebe|  if you never smoke again i'll give you seven thousand dollars! |chandler|  yeah, alright.
monica| alright. phoebe? |phoebe| okay, okay. if i were omnipotent for a day, i would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...and bigger boobs! 
ross| yeah, see.. you took mine. chandler, what about you? |chandler| uh, if i were omnipotent for a day, i'd.. make myself omnipotent forever. 
rachel| see, there's always one guy.  |all| hey joey. hi. hey, buddy. 
monica| hey, joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent? |joey| probably kill myself! 
monica| ..excuse me? |joey| hey, if little joey's dead, then i got no reason to live! 
ross| joey, uh- omnipotent. |joey| you are? ross, i'm sorry.. 
monica| how does she do that? |ross| i cannot sleep in a public place. 
monica| would you look at her? she is so peaceful. |phoebe|  oh! what what what! ...hi. 
ross| it's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. |monica| what's going on with you? 
phoebe| i got no sleep last night! |ross| why? 
phoebe| my grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. oh, and deaf. so they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. you have no idea how loud they are! |monica| well, if you want, you can stay with rachel and me tonight. 
phoebe| thanks. |joey| ...ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. see, i told you! less than a hundred steps from our place to here. 
chandler| you got waaaay too much free time. |joey|  hey! here's the birthday boy! ross, check it out: hockey tickets, rangers-penguins, tonight at the garden, and we're taking you. 
chandler| happy birthday, pal! |joey| we love you, man.  
ross| funny, my birthday was seven months ago. |joey| so? 
ross| so, i'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? |chandler| well, aren't we mr. \the glass is half empty.\ 
ross| oh my god, oh- is today the twentieth, october twentieth? |monica| oh, i was hoping you wouldn't remember.

joey| the hell with hockey, let's all do that! |chandler|  huh? huh? huh? 
ross| what are you doing? |chandler|  i have no idea.

rachel| what's that? |monica| weeeell, it's rum, and- 
rachel| okay.  |monica| we thought since phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. we got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got twister...  
phoebe| ooh! ooh! and i brought operation! but, um, i lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. but we can prep the guy! |monica| uh, rach, it's the visa card people. 
rachel| oh, god, ask them what they want. |monica|  um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account. 
rachel| but i haven't used my card in weeks! |monica| that is the unusual activity. look, they just wanna see if you're okay. 
rachel| they wanna know if i'm okay. okay.. they wanna know if i'm okay, okay, let's see. well, let's see, the fica guys took all my money, everyone i know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and i'm getting coffee! and it's not even for me! so if that sounds like i'm okay, okay, then you can tell them i'm okay, okay? |monica|  uh- rachel has left the building, can you call back? 
rachel| alright, c'mon!  let's play twister!|ross|  sorry, sorry... uh-oh. 
chandler| what? there was ice there that night with carol? plastic seats? four thousand angry pittsburgh fans? |ross| no, actually i was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. but now you mention it, there was ice there that night... it was the first frost... 
joey| c'mon, sit. just sit down, sit. |monica| you should feel great about yourself! you're doing this amazing independence thing! 
rachel| monica, what is so amazing? i gave up, like, everything. and for what? |phoebe| you are just like jack. 
rachel| ...jack from downstairs? |phoebe| no, jack and the beanstalk. 
monica| ah, the other jack. |phoebe| yeah, right! see, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. and then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. and he lived in a village, and you live in the village.. 
rachel| okay, but pheebs, pheebs, jack gave up a cow, i gave up an orthodontist. okay, i-i-i know, i know i didn't love him- |phoebe| oh, see, jack did love the cow. 
rachel| but see, it was a plan. y'know, it was clear. it was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... |phoebe| floopy? 
rachel| yeah. |monica| so what, you're not the only one. i mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. you've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. 
phoebe| oh, like that's a word. |rachel| okay, but monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together? 
monica| ...pheebs? |phoebe| oh, well... 'cause.... you just... i don't like this question. 
rachel| okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? i mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? |ross| get him! get him! get him! get- yesss! not laughing now, are ya pal! 
chandler|  see buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. |ross| pass it! pass it! 
chandler| he's open! |all| shoot! shoot! shoot! 
chandler| hey, look, we're on that tv thing! |chandler| 'scuse me. 
receptionist|  it says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. well, i'm not completely satisfied. |chandler| listen, it's kind of an emergency. well, i guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.  
receptionist|  |ross|  look, i don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but i'm in a lot of pain here, alright? my face is dented. 
receptionist| well, you'll have to wait your turn. |joey| well, how long do you think it'll be? 
receptionist|  any minute now. |ross| hey, this-  heyy... 
rachel| i'm so sorry, you guys. i didn't mean to bring you down. |monica| no, you were right. i don't have a plan.  
pizza guy|  pizza guy! |rachel| thank god. food.  
monica| phoebe? |phoebe| what? 
monica| do you have a plan? |phoebe| i don't even have a 'pl'. 
pizza guy| hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion? |rachel|  no, no, that's not what we ordered... we ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. 
pizza guy| wait, you're not 'g.stephanopoulos?' man, my dad's gonna kill me! |monica|  wait! did you say 'g.stephanopoulos?' 
pizza guy| yeah. this one goes across the street, i must have given him yours. oh, bonehead, bonehead! |monica| wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks? 
pizza guy| yeah, that sounds about right. |monica| was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
phoebe| and-and a power tie? |pizza guy| no, pretty much just a towel. 
monica|  oh god. |pizza guy| so you guys want me to take this back? 
monica| are you nuts?! we've got george stephanopoulos' pizza!  |rachel| uh, pheebs? who's george snuffalopagus? 
phoebe| big bird's friend. |monica| i see pizza! 
phoebe| oh, i wanna see! lemme see! lemme see!  |rachel| hello? who are we spying on? 
monica| white house adviser? clinton's campaign guy? the one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? |rachel| oh, him, the little guy? oh, i love him! 
phoebe| ooh, wait.. wait, i see a woman. |monica| please tell me it's his mother. 
phoebe| definitely not his mother. |monica| oh, no... 
phoebe| oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza-  |chandler| excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. i mean, that guy with the toe thing? who's he sleeping with?  ba-! 
monica| light still out? |rachel| yeah. 
monica| oh. maybe they're- napping. |rachel| oh please, they're having sex. 
monica and phoebe| shut up! |rachel| so, whaddya think george is like? 
monica| i think he's shy. |phoebe| yeah? 
monica| yeah. i think you have to draw him out. and then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. |ross| i remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow. 
chandler| yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- could i get some painkillers over here, please? |joey| he's right, enough, already. what is the big deal about today? so you slept with her for the first time, so what? you slept with her for seven years after that. 
ross| look, it's just a little more complicated... |chandler| well, what? what? what is it? that she left you? that she likes women? that she left you for another woman that likes women? 
ross| little louder, okay, i think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... |chandler| then what? 
ross| my first time with carol was...  |joey| what? 
ross| it was my first time. |joey| with carol?  oh. 
chandler| so in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh. |joey| whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! there was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! 
monica| okay. okay, i got one. do you remember that vegetarian pate that i made that you loved so much? |phoebe| uh-huh. 
monica| well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah! |phoebe| oh! oh! oh! okay, fine, fine. now i don't feel so bad about sleeping with jason hurley. 
monica| what?! you slept with jason? |phoebe| you'd already broken up. 
rachel| how long? |phoebe| a couple hours. 
monica| oh, that's nice! |rachel| okay, okay, okay, i got one!  anyway- the valentine tommy rollerson left in your locker was really from me. 
monica| excuse me?! |rachel| hello? like he was really gonna send you one?  she was a big girl. 
monica| really. well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade! |rachel| i was laughing! you made me laugh!  
phoebe| there he is! there he is! |monica| where? 
phoebe| right- where we've been looking all night! |rachel| he is so cute! 
monica| oh, george, baby, drop the towel! |all| yeah, drop it! drop the towel! please drop thewowww. 
joey| man. can you believe he's only had sex with one woman? |chandler| i think it's great. y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic... 
joey| really? |chandler| no, you kidding? the guy's a freak..  
both| hey, buddy. |ross| hi.  
receptionist|  oh, that's attractive. |chandler| oh, i thought you were great in silence of the lambs. oh come on, admit it! all things considered, you had fun tonight. 
ross| fun? where was the fun? tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? where's my puck? |joey| oh, ah- the kid has it. 
ross| the kid...?  excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck. |kid| i found it. finders keepers, losers weepers.  
chandler| you gotta do it, man. |ross|  listen, uh- gimme back my puck. 
kid| no. |ross| 'yes', how about. c'mere. gimme! 
kid| no! no!  |receptionist| hey! hey! no rough holding in my er! 
ross|  |ross| ...now that was fun. 
ross|  okay, monica: right foot red. |monica| could've played monopoly, but nooooo. 
chandler| thanks.  |ross| okay, pheebs: right hand blue.  
chandler| hello? oh, uh, rachel, it's the visa card people. |rachel| oh, okay. will you take my place? 
chandler| alright.  yes, this is rachel. |rachel| nooo!  oh, well, thanks, but, i'm okay, really. 
ross| green. to the green. |rachel|  never-never mind. 
chandler| to the left, to the left- aww!  |rachel|  ohhh... i'm fine.
monica| would you let it go? it's not that big a deal.|ross| not that big a deal? it's amazing. ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. all right, as far as i'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. am i right?
rachel| come on! you guys can pee standing up.|chandler| we can? all right, i'm tryin' that.
joey| ok, you know what blows my mind? women can see breasts any time they want. you just look down and there they are. how you get any work done is beyond me.|phoebe| oh, ok, you know what i don't get? the way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
ross| multiple orgasms!|chandler| so, saturday night, the big night, date night, saturday night, sat-ur-day night!
joey| no plans, huh?|chandler| not a one.
ross| not even, say, breaking up with janice?|chandler| oh, right, right, shut up.
monica| chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. you just gotta do it.|chandler| no, i know, but it's just so hard, you know? i mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
joey| why do you have to break up with her? be a man, just stop calling. |phoebe| you know, if you want, i'll do it with you.
chandler| oh, thanks, but i think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. |phoebe| no, i mean you break up with janice and i'll break up with tony. 
ross| tony?|monica| oh, you're breaking up with tony?
phoebe| yeah, i know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? i don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, i don't know.|rachel|  does anybody want anything else?
ross| oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  nothing, just, just, i'm fine.|phoebe|  what's the matter? why so scrunchy?
rachel| it's my father. he wants to give me a mercedes convertible.|ross| that guy, he burns me up.
rachel| yeah, well, it's a mercedes if i move back home. oh, it was horrible. he called me young lady.|chandler| ooh, i hate when my father calls me that.
monica| did he give you that whole \you're-not-up-to-this\ thing again?|rachel| oh, yeah, yeah. actually, i got the extended disco version, with three choruses of \you'll never make it on your own\.
phoebe|  uh-huh, uh-huh.|angela| hi, joey.
joey| my god, angela.|monica| wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
phoebe| are you gonna go over there?|joey| no, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. i don't wanna seem too eager. one mississippi, two mississippi, three mississippi. that seems pretty cool.  hey, angela. 
angela|  joey.|joey| you look good.
angela| that's because i'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.|joey| you don't say.
ross| so, uh, rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?|rachel| oh, big glamour night. me and monica at laundorama.
ross| oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? guess who's doing laundry there too?|rachel| who?
ross| me. was that not clear? hey, why don't, um, why don't i just join you both, here?|rachel| don't you have a laundry room in your building?
ross| yes, i do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. anyway, say, sevenish?|rachel| sure.
angela| forget it joey. i'm with bob now.|joey| bob? who the hell's bob?
angela| bob is great. he's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. you, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but bob...|joey| come on, we were great together. and not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
angela| yeah, well, sorry, joe. you said let's just be friends, so guess what?|joey| what?
angela| we're just friends.|joey| fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? you know, as friends?
angela| what four of us?|joey| you know, you and bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, monica.
joey| monica, i'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.|monica| forget it. not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
joey| come on. this guy's great. his name's bob. he's angela's... brother. he's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. me, i go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but bob is...|monica|  oh, god help us.
joey| what?|monica| ugly naked guy's laying kitchen tile. eww!
joey| eww! look, i'm asking a favor here. if i do this for her brother, maybe angela will come back to me.|monica| what's going on here? you go out with tons of girls.
joey|  i know, but, i made a huge mistake. i never should have broken up with her. will you help me? please?|ross|  well, monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and rachel.
chandler| oh. well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?|ross| it's laundry. the thinking through is minimal.
chandler| it's just you and rachel, just the two of you? this is a date. you're going on a date.|ross| nuh-uh.
chandler| yuh-huh.|ross| so what're you saying here? i should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
chandler| well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. this is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?|ross|  no.
chandler| oh, and uh, the fabric softener?|ross| ok, ok, now what is wrong with my snuggles? what, it says i'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. ok, i can pick something else up on the way.
chandler| there you go.|monica| thank you. so what does this bob guy look like? is he tall? short?
joey| yep.|monica| which?
joey| which what?|monica| you've never met bob, have you?
joey| no, but he's...|monica| oh my god, joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
angela| hey, joey.|monica| ...horribly attractive. i'll be shutting up now.
chandler| where are they? where are they?|phoebe| this is nice. we never do anything just the two of us.
chandler| it's great. maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.|phoebe| eww, i don't wanna do that.
chandler| here we go.|phoebe| ok, have a good break-up.
chandler| hey, janice.|janice| oh, my god, i am so glad you called me. i had the most supremely awful day.
chandler| hey, that's not good. can i get an espresso and a latte over here, please?|janice| we got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, i blew off the rest of the day, and i went shopping...... and i got you, i'm looking, i'm looking, i'm looking, i got you...
chandler| what?|janice| what?
chandler|  what... did you get me there? |janice| i got you...these. 
chandler| bullwinkle socks. that's so sweet.|janice| well, i knew you had the rockys, and so i figured, you know, you can wear bullwinkle and bullwinkle, or you can wear rocky and rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. whatever you want.
chandler| that's great. |chandler| well, i'm gonna get another espresso. can i get you another latte?
janice|  no, no, i'm still working on mine.|chandler| that's it?
phoebe| yeah, it was really hard.|chandler| oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
phoebe| ok, you weren't there.|woman| comin' through. move, move.
rachel| oh, 'scuse me. i was kinda using that machine.|woman| yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
rachel| but i saved it. i put my basket on top.|woman| oh, i'm sorry, is that your basket? it's really pretty. unfortunately, i don't see suds.
rachel| what?|woman| no suds, no save. ok?
ross| what's goin' on?|rachel| hi, uh, nothing. that horrible woman just took my machine.
ross| was your basket on top?|rachel| yeah, but, there were no suds.
ross| so?|rachel| well, you know, no suds, no save.
ross| no suds? excuse me, hold on a second.  that's my friend's machine.|woman| hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
ross| hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. |ross|  ok, let's do laundry.
rachel| that was amazing. i can't even send back soup.|ross| well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...do you, uh, do you...oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
rachel| what's that?|ross| uberveiss. it's new, it's german, it's extra-tough.
ross| rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?|rachel| oh god. oh, am i being like a total laundry spaz? i mean, am i supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? 
ross| rach, have you never done this before?|rachel| well, not myself, but i know other people that have. ok, you caught me. i'm a laundry virgin.
ross| uh, well, don't worry, i'll use the gentle cycle. ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.|rachel|  ok, well, what about these are white cotton panties. would they go with whites or delicates?
ross|  uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.|monica|  so, where did you guys grow up?
angela| brooklyn heights.|bob| cleveland.
monica| how, how did that happen?|joey| oh my god.
monica| what?|joey| i suddenly had the feeling that i was falling. but i'm not.
joey| so, you and angela, huh?|bob| yep. pretty much.
joey| you're a lucky man. you know what i miss the most about her? that cute nibbly noise when she eats. like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.|bob| huh, i never really noticed.
joey| oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.|bob| monica, monica is great.
joey| yeah, but it's not gonna last. she's too much for me in bed. sexually.|monica| i've gotta tell you, bob is terrific.
angela| yeah, isn't he?|monica| it is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
angela| you know what else? he's unbelievable in bed.|monica| wow. my brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
angela| huh. that's nice.|phoebe| ok, you can do this. it's just like pulling off a band-aid. just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
chandler| janice. hi, janice. ok, here we go. i don't think we should go out anymore. janice.|janice| all right. well, there you go.  stop it, stop it, stop it.
rachel| ok, i know this is gonna sound really stupid, but i feel that if i can do this, you know, if i can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything i can't do.|ross| that does not sound stupid to me. you know, it's like the first time i had to make dinner for myself, after carol left me?  uh-oh.
rachel| what uh-oh?|ross|  uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
rachel| ross, what's the matter?|ross| nothing, nothing. lee-lo, the laundry's done.
rachel| come on, show me.|ross| all right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
rachel| oh, everything's pink.|ross| yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. i'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
rachel| except it didn't. it happened to me. oh, god, i'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. what am i doing? what am i doing? my father's right. i can't live on my own! i can't even do laundry!|monica| something went wrong with underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. so anyway, um, his head is like flopping down broadway, right, and i'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. um, i've got something in my eye, uh, joey, could we check it in the light, please? 
monica| oh my god.|joey| what?
monica| hello! were we at the same table? it's like... cocktails in appalachia.|joey| come on, they're close.
monica| close? she's got her tongue in his ear.|joey| oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with ross.
monica| joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?|joey| well, who's to say what's true? i mean...
monica| oh my god, what were you thinking?|joey| all right, look, i'm not proud of this, ok? well, maybe i am a little.
monica|  oh! |joey| ow!
monica|  i'm outta here.|joey| wait, wait, wait. you want him, i want her. he likes you.
monica| really?|joey| yeah. i'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
monica| i'm so sorry, i can't believe i did this, but i couldn't stop laughing at your norman mailer story.|joey| uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
chandler| here's the thing, janice. you know, i mean, it's like we're different. i'm like the bing, bing, bing. you're like the boom, boom, ... boom.|janice| ow!
chandler| oh, my god, i'm so sorry. are you ok?|janice| ow. um, it's just my lens. it's just my lens. i'll be right back.
chandler|  i hit her in the eye! i hit her in the eye! this is the worst break-up in the history of the world. |phoebe| oh my god.  how many of those have you had?
chandler| oh, i don't know, a million?|phoebe| chandler, easy, easy. go to your happy place. la la la la la la la.
chandler| i'm fine.|phoebe| all right. 
chandler| i'm not fine. here she comes.|phoebe| wait here. breathe.
chandler| how do you do that?|phoebe| it's like a gift.
chandler| we should always always break up together.|phoebe| oh, i'd like that.
ross| you got the clothes clean. now that's the important part.|rachel| oh, i guess. except everything looks like jammies now.
rachel| whoa, i'm sorry. excuse me. we had this cart.|woman| yeah, well, i had a 24-inch waist. you lose things. now come on, get outta my way.
rachel| i'm sorry, you know, maybe i wasn't being clear. uh, this is our cart.|woman| hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
rachel| hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!|woman| let go!
rachel| all right, listen, missy. if you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it! |rachel|  yes! did you see that?
ross| you were incredible! brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.|rachel| i could not have done this without you.
ross| ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?  i'm fine, i'm fine.|rachel| are you sure?
ross| no.|rachel| oh, are you sure you're ok?
ross| yeah.|rachel| does it still hurt?
ross| yeah.|phoebe|  what a neat idea. all your clothes match. i'm gonna do this.
monica| hi.|phoebe| hey, how'd it go?
joey| excellent.|monica| we ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
ross| what a beautiful story. hey, i'm fine by the way.|monica|  oh, i'm sorry.
rachel| where's chandler?|phoebe| oh, he needed some time to grieve.
chandler| i'm free! i'm free!|phoebe| that oughta do it.
rachel|  ooh! look! look! look! look, there's joey's picture! this is so exciting!|chandler| you can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
phoebe| the exclamation point in the title scares me.  y'know, it's not just freud, it's freud!|ross| oh, shhh, shh. magic is about to happen.
joey| vell, eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and i vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.  |rachel| god. i feel violated.
monica| did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?|chandler|  ross, ten o'clock.
ross| is it? feels like two.|chandler| no, ten o'clock.
ross| what?|chandler|  there's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
ross| oh. hel-lo!|chandler| she's amazing! she makes the women that i dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
monica| well, go over to her! she's not with anyone.|chandler| oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'excuse me. blarrglarrghh.'
rachel| oh, c'mon. she's a person, you can do it!|chandler| oh please, could she be more out of my league? ross, back me up here.
ross| he could never get a woman like that in a million years.|chandler| thank you, buddy.
phoebe| oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.|monica| you could do that!
chandler| y'think?|all| yeah!
chandler| oh god, i can't believe i'm even considering this... i'm very very aware of my tongue...|ross| c'mon! c'mon!
chandler| here goes. |aurora| ...yes?
chandler| hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... chandler! chandler is my name, and, uh......hi.|aurora| yes, you said that.
chandler| yes, yes i did, but what i didn't say was what i was about to say, what i wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.  |aurora| chandler?
all| hey! you're in a play! i didn't know you could dance! you had a beard!|joey| whadja think?
all| ...hey! you're in a play! i didn't know you could dance! you had a beard!|joey| c'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. it was better than that thing i did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
all|  saw your head. saw your head.|chandler| 
rachel| what is it?|joey| the estelle leonard talent agency. wow, an agency left me its card! maybe they wanna sign me!
phoebe| based on this play? ...based on this play!|chandler| hey, kids. 
all| hey.|phoebe|  no, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
chandler| well, i can't believe i've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.|monica| oh, right, right. how was your date, 'chand-lrr'?
chandler| it was unbelievable. i-i've never met anyone like her. she's had the most amazing life! she was in the israeli army...|aurora| ...luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. so, we made it to the border, but just barely, and i- ...i've been talking about myself all night long, i'm sorry. what about you? tell me one of your stories.
chandler| alright. once i got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and i rode it all the way to brooklyn... just for the hell of it.|chandler| we talked 'til like two. it was this perfect evening... more or less.
aurora| ...all of a sudden we realised we were in yammon. |chandler| oh, i'm sorry, so 'we' is?
aurora| 'we' would be me and rick.|joey| who's rick?
chandler| who's rick?|aurora| my husband.
all| ooooohhh.|chandler| oh, so you're divorced?
aurora| no.|chandler| oh, i'm sorry, then you're widowed?...hopefully?
aurora| no, i'm still married.|chandler| so tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
aurora| don't worry. i imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with ethan.|chandler| ethan? there's, there's an ethan?
aurora| mmmm... ethan is my... boyfriend.|all| what?!
chandler| so explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?|aurora| i suppose mainly sexual.
chandler| ...hm.|monica| oh. i'm sorry it didn't work out.
chandler| what 'not work out'? i'm seeing her again on thursday. didn't you listen to the story?|monica| didn't you listen to the story? i mean, this is twisted! how could you get involved with a woman like this?
chandler| well, y'know, i had some trouble with it at first too, but the way i look at it is, i get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. i mean, this is every guy's fantasy!|phoebe| oh, yeah. that is not true. ross, is this your fantasy?
ross| no, of course not!  ...yeah, yeah, it is.|monica| what? so you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
joey| i couldn't do it.|monica| good for you, joey.
joey| when i'm with a woman, i need to know that i'm going out with more people than she is.|ross| well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. i mean, anthropologically speaking-
ross| fine. fine, alright, now you'll never know.|monica| we're kidding. c'mon, tell us!
all| yeah! c'mon!|ross| alright. there's a theory, put forth by richard leakey-
rachel| tah-daaah!|chandler| are we greeting each other this way now? 'cause i like that.
rachel| look! i cleaned! i did the windows, i did the floors... i even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, i don't know what that's for.|ross| oh yeah, nobody knows. and we're not supposed to ask.
rachel| well, whaddya think?|all| very clean! it looks great! terrific!
monica| ...oh! i-i see you moved the green ottoman.|all| uh-oh...
monica| how-how did that happen?|rachel| i dunno.. i-i thought it looked better there. and i- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
monica| yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot.  alright, just to compare. let's see. well, it looks good there too. let's just leave it there for a while.|phoebe|  i can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
chandler| thank god you didn't try to fan out the magazines. i mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.|monica| you guys, i am not that bad!
phoebe| yeah, you are, monica. remember when i lived with you? you were like, a little, y'know,  ree! ree! ree! ree!|monica| that is so unfair!
ross| oh c'mon! when we were kids, yours was the only raggedy ann doll that wasn't raggedy!|monica| okay, so i'm responsible, i'm organised. but hey, i can be a kook.
ross| alright, you madcap gal. try to imagine this. the phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.|monica| why not?
ross| because you're a kook! instead you wait until they send you a notice.|monica| i could do that.
rachel| okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and i buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.|monica| why would someone do that?! ...one might wonder.
chandler| someone's left a glass on the coffee table. there's no coaster. it's a cold drink, it's a hot day. little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...|monica| stop it!! ...oh my god. it's true! who am i?
ross| monica? you're mom.|phoebe| ree! ree! ree! ree! ree!
joey|  my agent has just gotten me a job...in the new al pacino movie!|all| oh my god! whoah!
monica| well, what's the part?|joey| can you believe this? al pacino! this guy's the reason i became an actor! \i'm out of order? pfeeeh. you're out of order! this whole courtroom's out of order!\
phoebe| seriously, what-what's the part?|joey| \just when i thought i was out, they pull me back in!\
ross| c'mon, seriously, joey, what's the part?|joey| ...i'm his 
rachel| ..you're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?|joey| ...i'm his butt double. 'kay? i play al pacino's butt. alright? he goes into the shower, and then- i'm his butt.
monica|  oh my god.|joey| c'mon, you guys. this is a real movie, and al pacino's in it, and that's big!
chandler| oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.|joey| okay, okay, fine! make jokes, i don't care! this is a big break for me!
ross| you're right, you're right, it is...so you gonna invite us all to the big opening?|monica| alright, alright, alright... 
joey| here. i need to borrow some moisturizer.|monica| for what?
joey| whaddya think? today's the big day!|monica| oh my god. okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
joey| thank you! |chandler| where's joey? his mom's on the phone.
monica| he's in the bathroom. i don't think you wanna go in there!|chandler| c'mon, we're roommates!  my eyes!! my eyes!!
monica| i warned you...|rachel| who is being loud?
chandler| oh, that would be monica. hey, listen, i wanna borrow a coupla things, aurora spent the night, i really wanna make her breakfast.|monica| oh, you got the whole night, huh?
chandler| yeah, well, i only have twenty minutes until ethan, so, y'know.. |rachel| ooh, do i sense a little bit of resentment?
chandler| no, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'kay? y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? well, every- single- second is like that with aurora.. and i've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. monica, can you help me with the door? |monica| sure. oh, um, chandler? y'know, the-the old monica would-would remind you to scrub that teflon pan with a plastic brush...but i'm not gonna do that. 
director|  okay, everybody ready?|joey| uh, listen, i just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
director| lose the robe.|joey| me?
director| that would work.|joey| right. okay. losing the robe.  and the robe is lost.
director| okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.|director| and cut. hey, butt guy, what the hell are you doing?
joey| well, i'm- i'm showering.|director| no, that was clenching.
joey| oh. well, the way i see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? i mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... i think his butt would be angry here.|director| i think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. what was that?
joey| i was going for quiet desperation. but if you have to ask...|chandler| god, i love these fingers...
aurora| thank you.|chandler| no, actually i meant my fingers. look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
aurora| |chandler| oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. 
aurora| okay.|chandler| don't go.
aurora| okay. oh no, i have to.|chandler|  too bad, she's leaving.
aurora|  i'm sorry. he'll be waiting for me.|chandler| well, i thought- i thought you talked to rick.
aurora| it's not rick.|chandler| what, ethan? he got to spend the whole day with you!
aurora| no, it's-it's andrew. |chandler| i know there'll be many moments in the years to come when i'll regret asking the following question, but- and andrew is?
aurora| he's... new.|chandler| oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by rick, ethan and myself?
aurora| no, that's not exactly what i was..|chandler| well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
aurora| so what do you want?|chandler| you.
aurora| you have me!|chandler| nono, just you.
aurora| whaddyou mean?|chandler| lose the other guys.
aurora| ...like, ...all of them?|chandler| c'mon, we're great together, why not?
aurora| why can't we just have what we have now? why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight i thought that's what you wanted too.|chandler| ...well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like i'm two guys, y'know? i mean, one guy's going 'shut up! this is great!' but there's this other guy. actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... and he's saying, y'know, 'this is too hard! get out! get out!'
aurora| so... which one of the two guys will you listen to?|chandler| i don't know, i-i have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
aurora| which one?|chandler| ...the second guy.
aurora|  well, call me if you change your mind.|chandler| sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
ross| look at it this way: you dumped her. right? i mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... tell me why you did this again?|all| hey!
monica| hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new al pacino movie?|joey| nope.
ross| no? what happened, big guy?|chandler|  \big guy?\
ross| it felt like a 'big guy' moment.|joey| i got fired.
all| oh!|joey| yeah, they said i acted too much with it. i told everybody about this! now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
rachel| oh, joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.|joey| my mom will.
chandler| something so sweet and...disturbing about that.|joey| y'know, i've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. and i finally get my shot, and i blow it!
monica| maybe this wasn't your shot.|ross| yeah, i mean... i think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. did it... feel like your shot..?
joey| hard to tell, i was naked.|phoebe| no, i don't think this was your shot. i mean, i don't even think you just get one shot. i really believe big things are gonna happen for you, i do! you've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'i got the part! i got the part! i'm gonna be joey tribbiani's ass!'.
joey| yeah? that's so nice! |monica| i'm sorry, joey. i'm gonna go to bed, guys. 
all| night.|rachel| uh, mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
monica|  uh-huh!|rachel| really? just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
monica| doesn't matter, i'll get 'em tomorrow. or not. whenever. |ross| she is a kook.
phoebe| hi. um, i want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. ok, here we go.  ok, thank you very much.|chandler| oh, great. this is just...
rachel| wow, this is so cool, you guys. the entire city is blacked out!|monica| mom says it's all of manhattan, parts of brooklyn and queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
rachel| wow, you guys, this is big.|monica| 
phoebe| can i borrow the phone? i want to call my apartment and check on my grandma.  what's my number? |phoebe| well, i never call me.
chandler| oh my god, it's that victoria's secret model. something... something goodacre.|jill|  hi mom, it's jill.
chandler| she's right, it's jill. jill goodacre. oh my god. i am trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre!  is it a vestibule? maybe it's an atrium. oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!|jill|  yeah, i'm fine. i'm just stuck at the bank, in an atm vestibule.
chandler| jill says vestibule... i'm going with vestibule.|jill|  i'm fine. no, i'm not alone... i don't know, some guy.
chandler| oh! some guy. some guy. 'hey jill, i saw you with some guy last night. yes, he was some guy. |joey| hi everyone.
ross| and officiating at tonight's blackout, is rabbi tribbiani.|joey| well, chandler's old roomate was jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... happy chanukah, everyone.
phoebe|  eww, look. ugly naked guy lit a bunch of candles.|rachel| that had to hurt!
chandler| alright, alright, alright. it's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. oh god, do something. just make contact, smile!|chandler| there you go!
chandler| you're definitely scaring here.|jill| 
chandler| yeah, about 300 guys i went to high school with. yeah, thanks. |monica| hello?
chandler| hey, it's me.|monica|  are you ok?
chandler| yeah, i'm fine.  i'm trppd in an atm vstbl wth jll gdcr.|monica| what?
chandler| i'm trppd... in an atm vstbl... wth jll gdcr!|monica| i have no idea what you just said.
chandler|  put joey on the phone.|joey| what's up man?
chandler| i'm trppd... in an atm vstbl... wth jll gdcr.|joey| 
chandler| yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.|rachel| alright, somebody.
monica| ok, i'll go. ok, senior year of college... on a pool table.|all| whoooaa!
ross| that's my sister.|joey| ok... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the new york city public library.
monica| oh my god! what were you doing in a library?|ross| pheebs, what about you?
phoebe| oh... milwaukee.|rachel| um... ross?
ross| disneyland, 1989, 'it's a small world after all.'|all| no way!
ross| the ride broke down. so, carol and i went behind a couple of those mechanical dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the magic kingdom.|phoebe| oh, rachel.
rachel| oh come on, i already went.|monica| you did not go!
all| come on.|rachel| oh, alright. the weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed. 
ross| step back.|joey| we have a winner!
rachel| i just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.|ross| well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
rachel| there, well, see? barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course. |ross| come on.
rachel| no, he said we were holding up the people behind us.|ross|  and you didn't marry him because...?
rachel| i mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...|ross| probably. but you know, i'll tell you something. passion is way overrated. 
rachel| yeah right.|ross| it is. eventually, it kind of... burns out. but hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. so, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
rachel|  ok.|ross| but, um... i don't think that's going to be you.
rachel| you don't.|ross| uh-uh. see, i see.... big passion in your future.
rachel| really?|ross| mmmm.
rachel| you do?|ross| i do.
rachel| oh ross, you're so great. |joey| it's never gonna happen.
ross|  what?|joey| you and rachel.
ross|  why not?|joey| because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone. 
ross| no, no, no. i'm not in the zone.|joey| ross, you're mayor of the zone.
ross| i'm taking my time, alright? i'm laying the groundwork. yeah. i mean, every day i get just a little bit closer to...|joey| priesthood! look ross, i'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. if you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
ross| i will, i will. see, i'm waiting for the right moment.  what? what, now?|joey| yeeeeaaaahhh! what's messing you up? the wine? the candles? the moonlight? you've just got to go up to her and say, 'rachel, i think that...' 
ross| shhhh!|rachel| what are you shushing?
ross| we're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. listen.  don't you hear that?|rachel| ahhhh!
ross| see?|rachel| huh. 
jill| would you like some gum?|chandler| um, is it sugarless?
jill|  sorry, it's not.|chandler| oh, then no thanks. what the hell was that? mental note: if jill goodacre offers you gum, you take it. if she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
phoebe| |ross|  ok, here goes.
joey| are you going to do it?|ross| i'm going to do it.
joey| do you want any help?|ross| you come out there, you're a dead man.
joey| good luck, man.|ross| thanks.  ok.
joey| ok. |joey| hey, where are you going?
monica| outside.|joey| you can't go out there.
monica| why not?|joey| because of... the reason.
monica| and that would be?|joey| i, um, can't tell you.
monica| joey, what's going on?|joey| ok, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell ross that i told you.
monica| about what?|joey| he's planning your birthday party.
monica| oh my god! i love him!|joey|  you'd better act surprised.
phoebe| about what?|monica| my surprise party!
phoebe| what surprise party?|monica| oh stop it. joey already told me.
phoebe| well, he didn't tell me.|joey| hey, don't look at me. this is ross's thing.
phoebe| this is so typical. i'm always the last one to know everything.|monica| no, you are not. we tell you stuff.
phoebe| yuh-huh! i was the last one to know when chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. i was the last one to know when you had a crush on joey when he was moving in.  looks like i was second to last.|rachel| hmmm... this is so nice.
ross| ok, i have a question. well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.|rachel| ok.
ross| ok. here goes. for a while now, i've been wanting to, um....|rachel| ohhh!!!! 
ross| yes, yes, that's right...|rachel| oh, look at the little cat! 
ross| what?  ow!|monica|  this is just bactine. it won't hurt.
joey| sorry, that was wax.|phoebe| oh, poor little tooty is scared to death. we should find his owner.
ross| why don't we just put 'poor little tooty' out in the hall?|rachel| during a blackout? he'd get trampled!
ross|  yeah?|chandler| you know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.  'gum would be perfection'? 'gum would be perfection.' could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'i'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. for me, gum is perfection. i loathe myself.
phoebe|  oh no, the mendels, they hate all living things, right?|rachel| oh.  hi. we just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
mr. heckles| er, yeah, it's mine.|phoebe|  he seems to hate you. are you sure?
mr. heckles| yeah, it's my cat. give me my cat.|phoebe| wait a minute. what's his name?
mr. heckles| ehhhh... b-buttons.|rachel| bob buttons?
mr. heckles| mmm. bob buttons. here, bob buttons.|phoebe|  oooh! you are a very bad man!
mr. heckles|  you owe me a cat.|rachel| here, kitty-kitty. here kitty-kitty. where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...

rachel| well, the cat... the cat turned out to be paolo's cat!|ross| that, that is funny... .... and rachel keeps touching him.
phoebe| alright. i looked all over the building and i couldn't find the kitty anywhere.|rachel| oh, i found him. he was paolo's cat.
phoebe| ah! well! there you go! last to know again! and i'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is paolo.|rachel| ah, paolo, this is phoebe.
paolo| |phoebe|  you betcha!
chandler|  ah, let's see. what next? blow a bubble. a bubble's good. it's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. here we go.|chandler| nice going, imp. ok, it's ok. all i need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. 
chandler| good save! we're back on track, and i'm...  ..chewing someone else's gum. this is not my gum. oh my god! oh my god! and now you're choking. |jill| are you alright?

rachel|  oh my god, you guys, what am i doing? what am i doing? this is so un-me!|monica| if you want, i'll do it.
phoebe| i know, i just want to bite his bottom lip.  but i won't.|rachel| god, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in bermuda with barry.
phoebe| you know, did you ride mopeds? 'cause i've heard... ... oh, i see... it's not about that right now. ok.|rachel| y'know, i know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but goooooooddddddd....

ross| listen. um, listen. something you should... know... um, rachel and i... we're kind of a thing.|paolo| thing?
ross| thing, yes. thing.|paolo| ah, you... have the sex?
ross| no, no, no. technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. see, um, the point is that... rachel and i should be, er, together. you know, and if you get in the.... um... |paolo| bed?
ross| no, no, that's not where i was going. er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then i would be, well, very sad.|paolo| oh!
ross| yeah! se vice?|paolo| si.
ross| so you do know a little english.|paolo| poco... a leetle.
ross| do you know the word crapweasel?|paolo| no.
ross| that's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!|jill| chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! now watch, it's easy.
chandler| ok.|jill| ready? 
jill| no, you've got to whip it. |phoebe| oh, look look look. the last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...

chandler| yes. yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.|jill| well, goodbye chandler. i had a great blackout.  see ya.
shelley| question. you're not dating anybody, are you, because i met somebody who would be perfect for you.|chandler| ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
shelley| do you want a date saturday?|chandler| yes please.
shelley| okay. he's cute, he's funny, he's-|chandler| he's a he?
shelley| well yeah! ...oh god. i- just- i thought- good, shelley. i'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... okay, goodbye...|chandler| ...couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. i mean, is that ridiculous? can you believe she actually thought that?
rachel| um... yeah. well, i mean, when i first met you, y'know, i thought maybe, possibly, you might be... |chandler| you did?
rachel| yeah, but then you spent phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then i figured maybe not.|chandler| huh. did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
monica| i did.|phoebe| yeah, i think so, yeah.
joey| not me.|ross| nono, me neither. although, uh, y'know, back in college, susan sallidor did.
chandler| you're kidding! did you tell her i wasn't?|ross| no. no, it's just 'cause, uh, i kinda wanted to go out with her too, so i told her, actually, you were seeing bernie spellman... who also liked her, so...
chandler| well, this is fascinating. so, uh, what is it about me?|phoebe| i dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
chandler| ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?|all| yeah! right!
chandler| what is it?!|monica| okay, i-i d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
all| yes. absolutely. a quality.|chandler| oh, oh, a quality, good, because i was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
monica| hello? hello? oh! rachel, it's paolo calling from rome. |rachel| oh my god! calling from rome!  bon giorno, caro mio. 
ross|  so he's calling from rome. i could do that. just gotta go to rome.|rachel| monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? talking to rome.  i'm talking to rome.
monica| hey dad, what's up?  oh god. ross, it's nana.|ross| so, uh, how's she doing?
aunt lillian| the doctor says it's a matter of hours.|monica| how-how are you, mom?
mrs. geller| me? i'm fine, fine. i'm glad you're here. ...what's with your hair?|monica| what?
mrs. geller| what's different?|monica| nothing.
mrs. geller| oh, maybe that's it.|monica| she is unbelievable, our mother is...
ross| okay, relax, relax. we are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.|monica| oh god!
monica| the fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. |ross| oh! ...yeah, they were gross. oh, you know what i loved? her sweet 'n' los. how she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
mr. geller| not just restaurants, from our house.|nurse| mrs. geller?
ross| she looks so small. |monica| i know.
ross| well, at least she's with pop-pop and aunt phyllis now. |monica| g'bye, nana. 
ross| bye, nana. |monica| ross!
mrs. geller| what is going on?!|ross| y'know how-how the nurse said that-that nana had passed? well, she's not, quite..
mrs. geller| what?|ross| she's not- past, she's present, she's back.
aunt lillian|  what's going on?|mr. geller| she may have died.
aunt lillian| she may have died?|mr. geller| we're looking into it.
ross| i, uh, i'll go see. |nurse| this almost never happens!
ross| now she's passed.|chandler| i just have to know, okay. is it my hair?
rachel|  yes, chandler, that's exactly what it is. it's your hair.|phoebe| yeah, you have homosexual hair.
rachel| so, um, did she...|ross| twice.
joey| twice?|phoebe| oh, that sucks!
joey| you guys okay?|ross| i dunno, it's weird. i mean, i know she's gone, but i just don't feel, uh...
phoebe| maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.|ross| nono, she's gone.
monica| we checked. a lot.|phoebe| hm, i mean maybe no-one ever really goes. ever since my mom died, every now and then, i get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know?  oh! and debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- i always get this really strong debbie vibe whenever i use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...i miss her.
rachel| aw. hey, pheebs, want this? |phoebe| thanks!
rachel| sure. i just sharpened her this morning.|joey| now, see, i don't believe any of that. i think once you're dead, you're dead! you're gone! you're worm food!  ...so chandler looks gay, huh?
phoebe| y'know, i dunno who this is, but it's not debbie. |ross| i thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
mrs. geller| well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!|mrs. geller| sweetie, you think you can get in there?
ross|  i don't see why not.|ross| here's my retainer!
mr. geller| i was just thinking. when my time comes-|monica| dad!
mr. geller| listen to me! when my time comes, i wanna be buried at sea.|monica| you what?
mr. geller| i wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun. |monica| define fun.
mr. geller| c'mon, you'll make a day of it! you'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...|monica| ...and then we throw your body in the water... gee, that does sound fun.
mr. geller| everyone thinks they know me. everyone says 'jack geller, so predictable'. maybe after i'm gone, they'll say 'buried at sea! huh!'.|monica| that's probably what they'll say.
mr. geller| i'd like that.|chandler| hey, gorgeous.
shelley|  hey. look, i'm sorry about yesterday, i, um-|chandler| no, nono, don't- don't worry about it. believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
shelley| oh! okay! phew! |chandler| so, uh... what do you think it is about me?
shelley| i dunno, uh... you just have a-a...|chandler| ...quality, right, great.
shelley| y'know, it's a shame, because you and lowell would've made a great couple.|chandler| lowell? financial services' lowell, that's who you saw me with?
shelley| what? he's cute!|chandler| well, yeah... 's'no brian in payroll.
shelley| is brian...?|chandler| no! uh, i d'know! the point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, i'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
shelley| well, i think brian's a little out of your league.|chandler| excuse me? you don't think i could get a brian? because i could get a brian. believe you me. ...i'm really not.
ross|  this one?|aunt lillian| no.
ross| i have shown you everything we have. unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.|aunt lillian| you know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
mrs. geller| you're right. we'll go with the burgundy.|ross| oh! a fine choice. i'm coming out. 
aunt lillian| wait! we need shoes!|ross| okay. um, how about these? 
mrs. geller| that's really a day shoe.|ross| and where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
aunt lillian| could we see something in a slimmer heel?|ross|  okay, i have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. i can show you something in a silver that may work.
aunt lillian| no, it really should be burgundy.|mrs. geller| mm. unless we go with a different dress?
ross| no! nonono, wait a sec. i may have something in the back.|ross| oh my god..
mrs. geller| is everything all right, dear?|ross| yeah, just... just nana stuff.
ross|  how we doing, you guys ready?|monica| mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. did you know my ears are not my best feature?
ross| some days it's all i can think about. |phoebe|  hi, sorry i'm late, i couldn't find my bearings.
rachel| oh, you-you mean your earrings?|phoebe| what'd i say?
rachel|  hm-m.|monica| are these the shoes?
rachel| yes. paolo sent them from italy.|ross| what, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
joey|  morning. we ready to go?|chandler| well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...it's stuff like that, isn't it?
monica| it was a really beautiful service.|mrs. geller| it really was. oh, c'mere, sweetheart.  y'know, i think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
joey| what?|chandler| nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like brent mussberger.
joey| check it out, giants-cowboys. |chandler| you're watching a football game at a funeral?
joey| no, it's the pre-game. i'm gonna watch it at the reception.|chandler| you are a frightening, frightening man.
rachel| oh no! my new paolo shoes!|ross| oh, i hope they're not ruined.
phoebe| god, what a great day. ...what? weather-wise!|ross| i know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- i dunno, almost life-aff- 
all| god! ross!|ross| i'm fine. just-just... having my worst fear realised...
phoebe| okay, don't worry, i'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.|ross| what, what is it?
phoebe| you missed a belt loop. |ross| oh! no-n-
phoebe| okay, it's in spasm.|mrs. geller| here, sweetie, here. i took these when i had my golfing accident. 
chandler| oh, no-|andrea| sorry- hi, i'm dorothy's daughter.
chandler| hi, i'm chandler, and i have no idea who dorothy is.|phoebe| hey, look who's up! how do you feel?
ross| i feel great. i feel- great, i fleel great.|monica| wow, those pills really worked, huh?
ross| not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...i love you guys. you guys are the greatest. i love my sister |phoebe| ooh! that's so nice...
ross| ...chandler! |chandler| hey.
ross|  and listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. doesn't matter to me.|andrea| 
ross| rachel. rachel rachel.  i love you the most.|rachel|  oh, well you know who i love the most?
ross| no.|rachel| you!
ross| oh.. you don't get it! |mr. geller| whaddya got there?
joey|  just a, uh... hearing disability.|mr. geller| what's the score?
joey| seventeen-fourteen giants... three minutes to go in the third.|mr. geller| beautiful! 
rachel|  pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?|mrs. geller|  your grandmother would have hated this.
monica| well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.|mrs. geller| no, i'd be hearing about 'why didn't i get the honey-glazed ham?', i didn't spend enough on flowers, and if i spent more she'd be saying 'why are you wasting your money? i don't need flowers, i'm dead'.
monica| that sounds like nana.|mrs. geller| do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
monica| ...i can imagine.|mrs. geller| i'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
monica| that is a wonder. so tell me something, mom. if you had to do it all over again, i mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?|mrs. geller| tell her what?
monica| how she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.|mrs. geller| i'm not sure i know what you're getting at.
monica| do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?|mrs. geller| ...no. i think some things are better left unsaid. i think it's nicer when people just get along. 
monica| huh.|mrs. geller| more wine, dear?
monica| oh, i think so.|mrs. geller|  those earrings look really lovely on you.
monica| thank you. they're yours.|mrs. geller| actually they were nana's.
mr. geller| now i'm depressed! ... even more than i was.|rachel| hey, who's this little naked guy?
ross| that little naked guy would be me.|rachel| aww, look at the little thing.
ross| yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. can we be grown-ups now?|chandler| who are those people?
ross| got me.|monica| oh, that's nana, right there in the middle.  'me and the gang at java joe's'. 
rachel| wow, monica, you look just like your grandmother. how old was she there?|monica| let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
ross| looks like a fun gang. |joey| ooh, look-look-look-look-look! i got monica naked!
ross|  nono, that would be me again. i'm, uh, just trying something.|chandler| hey, lowell.
lowell| hey, chandler.|chandler| so how's it going there in financial services?
lowell| it's like mardi gras without the paper mache heads. how 'bout you?|chandler| good, good. listen, heh, i dunno what shelley told you about me, but, uh... i'm not.
lowell| i know. that's what i told her.|chandler| really.
lowell| yeah.|chandler| so- you can tell?
lowell| pretty much, most of the time. we have a kind of... radar.|chandler| so you don't think i have a, a quality?
lowell| speaking for my people, i'd have to say no. by the way, your friend brian from payroll, he is.|chandler| he is?
lowell| yup, and waaay out of your league. |chandler| out of my league. i could get a brian.  hey, brian.
rachel| terry, i, i, i know that i haven't worked here very long, but i was wondering, do you think it would be possible if i got a $100 advance in my salary?|terry| an advance?
rachel| it's so that i can spend thanksgiving with my family. see, every year we go skiing in vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but i sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why i took this job.|terry| rachel, rachel, sweetheart. you're a terrible, terrible waitress. really, really awful.
rachel| ok, i, i hear what you're sayin'. i'm with you. um, but i, but i'm trying really hard. and i think i'm doing better. i really do. does anybody need coffee?  oh, look at that.|rachel| excuse me, sir. hi, you come in here all time. i was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
guy| huh?|rachel| ok, ok, that's fine. fine. hey, i'm sorry about that spill before.  only $98.50 to go. 
monica| hey. ross, did you know mom and dad are going to puerto rico for thanksgiving?|ross| no, they're not.
monica| yes, they are. the blymens invited them.|ross| you're wrong.
monica| i am not wrong.|ross| you're wrong.
monica| no, i just talked to them.|ross|  i'm calling mom.
joey| hey, hey.|chandler| hey.
phoebe| hey.|chandler| and this from the cry-for-help department. are you wearing makeup?
joey| yes, i am. as of today, i am officially joey tribbiani, actor slash model.|chandler| that's so funny, 'cause i was thinking you look more like joey tribbiani, man slash woman.
phoebe| what were you modeling for?|joey| you know those posters for the city free clinic?
monica| oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those \healthy, healthy, healthy guys\?|phoebe| you know, the asthma guy was really cute.
chandler| do you know which one you're gonna be?|joey| no, but i hear lyme disease is open, so...  
chandler| good luck, man. i hope you get it.|joey| thanks.
ross|  well, you were right. how can they do this to us, huh? it's thanksgiving. |monica| ok, i'll tell you what. how about i cook dinner at my place? i'll make it just like mom's.
ross| will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?|monica| you know, they're not actually supposed to have...  i'll work on the lumps. joey, you're going home, right?
joey| yeah.|monica| and i assume, chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
chandler| yes, every single one of them.|monica| phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
phoebe| yes, and her boyfriend. but we're celebrating thanksgiving in december 'cause he is lunar.|monica| so you're free thursday, then.
phoebe| yeah. oh, can i come?|monica| yeah. rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to vail?
rachel| absolutely. shoop, shoop, shoop. only a hundred and two dollars to go.|chandler| i thought it was $98.50.
rachel| yeah, well it was. i, i broke a cup.|ross| well, i'm off to carol's.
phoebe| ooh, ooh! why don't we invite her?|ross|  ooh, ooh. because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
ross| hi, is uh, is carol here?|susan| no, she's at a faculty meeting.
ross| oh, i uh, just came by to pick up my skull. well, not mine, but...susan: come in.|ross| thanks. yeah, carol borrowed it for a class, and i have to get it back to the museum.
susan| what's it look like?|ross| kinda like a big face without skin.
susan| yes, i'm familiar with the concept. we can just look for it.|ross| ok.  wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
susan| well, you know, you have to take a course. otherwise, they don't let you do it. |ross|  hey, hey, yertle the turtle. a classic.
susan| actually, i'm reading it to the baby.|ross| the uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
susan| what, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?|ross| you're not serious, i mean, you really... you really talk to it?
susan| yeah, all the time. i want the baby to know my voice.|ross| do you uh, do you talk about me?
susan| yeah, yeah, all the time.|ross| really?
susan| but um, we just refer to you as bobo the sperm guy.|ross| look, if she's talking to it, i just think that i should get some belly time too. not that i believe any of this.
phoebe| oh, i believe it. i think the baby can totally hear everything. i can show you. look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.|chandler| i'd just like to say that i'm totally behind this experiment. in fact, i'd very much like to butter your head.
monica| hey, rach, did you make your money?|rachel| no, not even close. forget vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
monica| rach, here's your mail.|rachel| thanks, you can just put it on the table.
monica|  no, here's your mail.|rachel| thanks, you can just put it on the table.
monica|  would you just open it?|rachel| oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
monica| we all chipped in.|joey|  we did?
monica|  you owe me 20 bucks.|rachel| thank you. thank you so much!
monica|  chandler, here you go, got your traditional thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of funyuns.|rachel| wait, wait, chandler, this is what you're havin' for thanksgiving dinner? what, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
chandler| all right, i'm nine years old.|ross| oh, i hate this story.
chandler| we just finished this magnificent thanksgiving dinner. i have--and i remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.|rachel| oh my god.
chandler| yes. it's very difficult to appreciate a thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.|joey| uh, hi. we uh, we used to work together.
girl| we did?|joey| yeah, at macy's. you were the obsession girl, right? i was the aramis guy.  aramis? aramis? 
girl| yeah, right.|joey| i gotta tell you. you're the best in the business.
girl| get out.|joey| i'm serious. you're amazing. you know when to spritz, when to lay back.
girl| really? you don't know what that means to me.|joey| ooh, you smell great tonight. what're you wearing?
girl|  nothing.|joey| listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
girl| yeah.  oh.|joey| what's wrong?
girl| i just remembered, i have to do something.|joey| oh. what?
girl| um, leave.|joey| wait, wait, wait!
joey| so i guess you all saw it.|rachel| saw what?
phoebe| no, we were just laughing. you know, how laughter can be infectious.|joey| set another place for thanksgiving. my entire family thinks i have vd.
chandler| tonight, on a very special blossom.|monica| mmm, looking good. ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.  what?
ross| i don't know. it's just not the same without mom in the kitchen.|monica| all right, that's it. you know what? just get out of my way and stop moping.
ross| that's closer.|rachel| i got the tickets! i got the tickets! five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
chandler| oh, you must stop shooping.|rachel| ok, i'm gonna get my stuff.
joey| chandler, will you just come in already?|chandler| no, i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
phoebe| look out, incoming pumpkin pie!|chandler| ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
joey| hey, monica, i got a question. i don't see any tater tots.|monica| that's not a question.
joey| but my mom always makes them. it's like a tradition. you get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! it's bad enough i can't be with my family because of my disease.|monica| all right, fine. tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
ross| ok, i'm off to talk to my unborn child. |monica| ah!
ross| ok, mom never hit.|phoebe|  ok, all done.
monica| what, phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? ross needs lumps!|phoebe| oh, i'm sorry, oh, i just, i thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
monica| why would we do that?|phoebe| well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
monica| ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.|rachel| ok, good-bye you guys. thanks for everything.  oh, sorry! oh, sorry!
chandler| the most unbelievable thing has happened. underdog has just gotten away.|joey| the balloon?
chandler| no, no, the actual cartoon character. of course the balloon. it's all over the news. right before he reached macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park. i'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?|rachel| i can't, i gotta go.
chandler| come on. an 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. how often does that happen?|phoebe| almost never.
monica| got the keys? or got the keys!|rachel| ok.
carol| anytime you're ready.|ross| ok, ok, here we go.  ok, where am i talking to, here? i mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
carol| just aim for the bump.|ross| ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. you know, i, you know, can't do this. uh, this is too weird. i feel stupid.
carol| so don't do it, it's fine. you don't have to do it just because susan does it.|ross|  hello, baby. hello, hello.
rachel| i loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.|phoebe| yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? i mean, that was just mean.
monica| ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. why are we standing here?|rachel| we're waiting for you to open the door. you got the keys.
monica| no i don't.|rachel| yes, you do. when we left, you said, \got the keys.\
monica| no i didn't. i asked, \got the ke-eys?\|rachel| no, no, no, you said, \got the keys\.
chandler| do either of you have the keys?|monica|  the oven is on.
rachel| oh, i gotta get my ticket!|joey| wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
monica| well then get it, get it!|joey| that tone will not make me go any faster.
monica|  joey!|joey| that one will. 
ross| and everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. so, on a dare, i picked paleontology. and you have no idea what i'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. you're just happy you don't have gills anymore.|carol| look, you don't have to talk to it. you can sing to it if you want.
ross| oh, please. i am not singing to your stomach, ok?|susan| hi, how's it goin?
ross| shh!  hey, uh, did you just feel that?|carol| i did.
ross| does it always, uh--?|carol| no, no that was the first.
susan| keep singing! keep singing!|ross|  hey, hey, you're my baby, and i can't wait to meet you. when you come out i'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
susan| i felt it!|ross|  hey, hey, i'm your daddy. i'm the one without any breasts.
joey| nope, not that one.|monica| can you go any faster with that?
joey| hey, i got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. you do the math.|monica| why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
chandler|  for an emergency just like this.|rachel|  right now. but i'm not.
monica| i swear you said you had the keys.|rachel| no, i didn't. i wouldn't say i had the keys unless i had the keys, and i obviously didn't have the keys.
phoebe| ooh, ok, that's it. enough with the keys. no one say keys.|monica| why would i have the keys?
rachel| aside from the fact that you said you had them?|monica| but i didn't.
rachel| well, you should have.|monica| why?
rachel| because!|monica| why?
rachel| because!|monica| why? because everything is my responsibility? isn't it enough that i'm making thanksgiving dinner for everyone? you know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so i'm making different kinds of potatoes. does anybody care what kind of potatoes i want? nooooo, no, no!  just as long as phoebe gets her peas and onions, and mario gets his tots, and it's my first thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and i... i...
chandler| ok, monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. here we go.|monica| well, the turkey's burnt.  potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
ross| here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like mom's.|monica| no, it doesn't, does it? but you wanted lumps, ross?  well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
rachel| oh, god, this is great! the plane is gone, so it looks like i'm stuck here with you guys.|joey| hey, we all had better plans. this was nobody's first choice.
monica| oh, really? so why was i busting my ass to make this delicious thanksgiving dinner?|joey| you call that delicious? 
monica| stop it, stop it, stop it!|chandler| now this feels like thanksgiving.
phoebe| ooh. |rachel| what?
phoebe| ugly naked guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. oh my god. he's not alone. ugly naked guy's having thanksgiving dinner with ugly naked gal.|joey| i've gotta see this. all right ugly naked guy!
monica| ooh, ugly naked dancing!|phoebe| it's nice that he has someone.
chandler| shall i carve?|rachel| by all means.
chandler| ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?|ross| i don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
monica|  does anybody wanna split this with me?|joey| oh, i will.
phoebe| ooh, you guys have to make a wish.|monica| make a wish?
phoebe| come on, you know, thanksgiving. ooh, you got the bigger half. what'd you wish for?|joey| the bigger half.
chandler| i'd like to propose a toast. little toast here, ding ding. i know this isn't the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked.|all| that's so sweet.
ross| and hey, here's to a lousy christmas.|rachel| and a crappy new year.
all| oooh!|monica| w-wait. what is that?
ross| 'that' would be marcel. you wanna say hi?|monica| no, no, i don't.
rachel| oh, he is precious! where did you get him?|ross| my friend bethel rescued him from some lab.
phoebe| that is so cruel! why? why would a parent name their child bethel?|chandler| hey, that monkey's got a ross on its ass!
monica| ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?|ross| yeah. i mean, it's been kinda quiet since carol left, so...
monica| why don't you just get a roommate?|ross| nah, i dunno... i think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe-  ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
phoebe| so you guys, i'm doing all new material tonight. i have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.|chandler| might wanna open with the snowman.
all| hey, joey. hey, buddy.|monica| so, how'd it go?
joey| ahhhhhh, i didn't get the job.|ross| how could you not get it? you were santa last year.
joey| i dunno. some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. he's not even jolly, it's all political.|monica| so what are you gonna be?
joey| ah, i'm gonna be one of his helpers. it's just such a slap in the face, y'know?|rachel| hey, do you guys know what you're doing for new year's?  gee, what?! what is wrong with new year's?
chandler| nothing for you, you have paolo. you don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! man, i'm talking loud!|rachel| well, for your information, paolo is gonna be in rome this new year, so i'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. 
phoebe| yeah, you wish!|chandler| it's just that i'm sick of being a victim of this dick clark holiday. i say this year, no dates, we make a pact. just the six of us- dinner.
all| yeah, okay. alright.|chandler| y'know, i was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. 
all| woooo! yeah!|rachel| phoebe, you're on.
phoebe| oh, oh, good.|rachel|  okay, hi. ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, miss phoebe buffay. wooh!
phoebe|  |phoebe|  
phoebe|  |max| no. no, that's- that's okay.
phoebe| well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while i'm playing, then i assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!|chandler|  that guy's going home with a note!
david| noth- i was- i was just saying to my-|phoebe| could you speak up please?
david|  sorry, i wa- i was just saying to my friend that i thought you were the most beautiful woman that i'd ever seen in my- in my life. and then he said that- you said you thought|max| daryl hannah.
david| daryl hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and i said yeah, i liked her in splash, a lot, but not so much in- in wall street, i thought she had kind of a |max| hard quality.
david| -hard quality. and uh, while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling. |phoebe| okay, we're gonna take a short break. 
joey| hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!|ross| come here, marcel. sit here. 
rachel| pheebs, i can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. i mean god, by my sixth date with paolo, i mean he had already named both my breasts! ...ooh. did i just share too much?|ross| just a smidge.
phoebe| david's like, y'know, scientist guy. he's very methodical.|monica| i think it's romantic.
phoebe| me too! oh! did you ever see an officer and a gentleman?|rachel| yeah!
phoebe| well, he's kinda like the guy i went to see that with. except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... i just- i just wanna be with him all the time. day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... |chandler| wait a minute, wait a minute, i see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to new year's, aren't you. you're gonna break the pact. she's gonna break the pact.
phoebe| no, no, no, no, no, no. yeah, could i just?|chandler| yeah, 'cause i already asked janice.
monica| what?!|ross| c'mon, this was a pact! this was your pact! 
chandler| i snapped, okay? i couldn't handle the pressure and i snapped.|monica| yeah, but janice? that-that was like the worst breakup in history!
chandler| i'm not saying it was a good idea, i'm saying i snapped!|joey| hi. hi, sorry i'm late.
chandler| too many jokes... must mock joey! |joey| nice shoes, huh? 
chandler| aah, y'killing me!|monica| ross! he's playing with my spatulas again!
ross| okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?|monica| do you always have to bring him here?
ross| i didn't wanna leave him alone. alright? we- we had our first fight this morning. i think it has to do with my working late. i said some things that i didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...|chandler| y'know, if you're gonna work late, i could look in on him for you.
ross| oh, that'd be great! okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.|chandler| okay, but if he asks, i'm not going to lie.
david| ...but, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.|phoebe| okay, alright, i have a question, then. 
david| yuh.|phoebe| um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
david| uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. and, uh, the answer would be  yes. yes i was. but, see, i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.|phoebe| sure.
david| right. but, see, the longer i waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where i just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. and, uh, i'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.|phoebe| oh, david, i, i think you are a sweeping sorta fella. i mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
david| rrrreally.|phoebe| oh, yeah, oh, i'm sure of it. you should just do it, just sweep and throw me. 
david| ...now? now?|phoebe| oh yeah, right now.
david| okay, okay, okay. |phoebe| okay, now you're just kinda tidying. 
david| okay, what the hell, what the hell.  you want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?|phoebe| i can hop. 
ross| so tell me something. what does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?|monica| i'm sorry, okay. it's just that chandler has somebody, and phoebe has somebody- i thought i'd ask fun bobby.
chandler| fun bobby? your ex-boyfriend fun bobby?|monica| yeah.
joey| you know more than one fun bobby?|chandler| i happen to know a fun bob.
rachel|  okay, here we go...|joey| ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
rachel|  there. now there is.|ross| okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
joey| uh, four.|ross| four.
rachel| five.|ross| five. 
rachel| sorry. paolo's catching an earlier flight.|joey| yeah, and i met this really hot single mom at the store. what's an elf to do?
ross| okay, so i'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?|rachel| oh, c'mon. we'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
ross| hey, y'know, this is so not what i needed right now.|monica| what's the matter?
ross| oh, it's-it's marcel. he keeps shutting me out, y'know? he's walking around all the time dragging his hands... |chandler| that's so weird, i had such a blast with him the other night.
ross| really.|chandler| yeah, we played, we watched tv.. that juggling thing is amazing.
ross| what, uh... what juggling thing?|chandler| with the balled-up socks? i figured you taught him that.
ross| no.|chandler| y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. he just balled up socks... and a melon...
max| phoebe. hi. |phoebe| oh, hi max! hey, do you know everybody?
max| no. have you seen david?|phoebe| no, no, he hasn't been around.
max| well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. we are going to minsk.|phoebe| minsk?
max| minsk. it's in russia.|phoebe| i know where minsk is.
max| we got the grant. three years, all expenses paid.|phoebe| so when, when do you leave?
max| january first.|phoebe| hello?
david| hey!|phoebe| hi.
david| hi!  what-what're you doing here?|phoebe| um, well, max told me about minsk, so  congratulations! this is so exciting!
max| it'd be even more exciting if we were going.|phoebe| oh, you're not going?  oh, why?
max| tell her, david. 'i don't wanna go to minsk and work with lifson and yamaguchi and flench, on nonononononono. i wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' |david| thank you, max. thank you.
phoebe| so-so you're really not going?|david| i don't know. i don't know what i'm gonna do. i just- you decide.
phoebe| oh don't do that.|david| please.
phoebe| oh no no.|david| no, but i'm asking-
phoebe| oh, but i can't do that-|david| no, but i can't-
phoebe| it's your thing, and-|david| -make the decision-
phoebe| okay, um, stay.|david| stay.
phoebe| stay.|phoebe| getting so good at that! 
david| it was max's stuff. |janice| i love this artichoke thing! oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! 
chandler| you remember janice.|monica| vividly.
monica| hi.|sandy| hi, i'm sandy.
joey| sandy! hi! c'mon in! ...you brought your kids.|sandy| yeah. that's okay, right?
ross| par-tay! |monica| that thing is not coming in here.
ross| 'that thing'? this is how you greet guests at a party? let me ask you something, if i showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?|monica| i'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
ross| okay. he was more embarrassed about that than anyone. okay? and for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...|monica| alright. just keep him away from me.
ross| thank you.  alright, i'll, uh... catch up with you later.|monica| oh my gosh! rachel, honey.. are you okay? where-where's paolo?
rachel| rome. jerk missed his flight.|phoebe| and then... your face is bloated?
rachel| no. okay. i was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. something about how it was her cab first. and then the next thing i know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! so i'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as i'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. and i hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party?  are people eating my dip?|sandy| y'know, when i saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time i ever mentally undressed an elf.
joey| wow, that's, uh, dirty.|sandy| yeah.
joey| hey, kids...|ross|  look at him. i'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
janice|  there you are! haaah, you got away from me!|chandler|  but you found me!
janice| here, ross, take our picture.  smile! you're on janice camera!|chandler| kill me. kill me now. 
monica| hey everybody! it's fun bobby!|fun bobby| hey, sorry i'm late. but my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. but i-i-i couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here i am!
joey|  hey fun bobby! whoah! who died?|fun bobby| it's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least i'll- i get to see him again.
janice|  oh, i'm gonna blow this one up, and i'm gonna write 'reunited' in glitter.|chandler| alright, janice, that's it! janice... janice... hey, janice, when i invited you to this party i didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
janice| oh, no. oh, no.|chandler| i'm sorry you misunderstood...
janice| oh my god. you listen to me, chandler, you listen to me. one of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. |chandler| oh, will you give me the thing. 
phoebe| hi, max!|max| yoko.  i've decided to go to minsk without you.
david| wow.|max| it won't be the same- but it'll still be minsk. happy new year.
phoebe| are you alright?|david| yeah, i'm fine, i'm fine. 
phoebe| you're going to minsk.|david| no, i'm... not going to minsk.
phoebe| oh, you are so going to minsk. you belong in minsk. you can't stay here just 'cause of me.|david| yes i can. because if i go it means i have to break up with you, and i can't break up with you.
phoebe| oh yes, yes, yes you can. just say, um, 'phoebe, my work is my life and that's what i have to do right now'. and i say 'your work?! your work?! how can you say that?!'. and then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but i have no choice. can't you understand that?'. and i say  'no! no! i can't understand that!'.|david| uh, ow.
phoebe| ooh, sorry. um, and, and then you put your arms around me. and then you put your arms around me.  and, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.|david| i'll never forget you.
phoebe| and then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it.  i'm gonna miss you. you scientist guy.|dick clark|  hi, this is dick clark, live in times square. we're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in times square...
joey| there y'go, kids.|chandler| 
joey| you seen sandy?|chandler| ooh. uh, i don't know how to tell you this, but she's in monica's bedroom, getting it on with max, that scientist geek. ooh, look at that, i did know how to tell you.
rachel| vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.|all|  what?
rachel| the bll is drrbing!|dick clark|  in twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
chandler| and the moment of joy is upon us.|joey| looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
phoebe| everybody looks so happy. i hate that.|monica| not everybody's happy. hey bobby!
chandler| y'know, i uh.. just thought i'd throw this out here. i'm no math whiz, but i do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. |phoebe| i dunno. i don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
rachel| i can't kiss anyone.|monica| so i'm kissing everyone?
joey| nonono, you can't kiss ross, that's your brother.|ross| perfect. perfect. so now everybody's getting kissed but me.
chandler| alright, somebody kiss me. somebody kiss me, it's midnight! somebody kiss me!|joey| alrightalrightalright.  there.
ross|  i wanted this to work so much. i mean i'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.|rachel| ...i think that bitch cracked my tooth.
phoebe| do you think they have yesterday's daily news?|monica| why?
phoebe| just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.|monica| oh my god.  phoebe. don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression. 
phoebe| where?  ooh, come to momma.|monica| he's coming. be cool, be cool, be cool.
guy| nice hat.|monica and phoebe|  thanks.
phoebe| we should do something. whistle.|monica| we are not going to whistle.
phoebe| come on, do it.|monica| no!
phoebe| do it!|monica| no!
phoebe| do it do it do it!|monica|  woo-woo!
phoebe| i can't believe you did that!|monica| why did i 'woo-hoo'? i mean, what was i hoping would happen? that-that he'd turn round and say 'i love that sound, i must have you now'?
phoebe| i just wish there was something we could do.  hello. hello, coma guy. get up, you girl scout! up! up! up!|monica| phoebe, what are you doing?
phoebe| maybe nobody's tried this.|monica| i wish we at least knew his name... look at that face. i mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. i bet he's a lawyer.
phoebe| yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? that means he's artistic.|monica| okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. and- he can dance!
phoebe| oh! and, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'yeah, i understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.|monica| i wish all guys could be like him.
phoebe| i know.|chandler| are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
monica| he doesn't have anyone.|phoebe| yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
joey| i can't believe you said woowoo. i don't even say woowoo.|rachel| oh, she's coming up! she's coming up! 
jay leno|  folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'euphoria unbound': the always interesting nora tyler bing. you might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.|chandler| y'know, we don't have to watch this. weekend at bernie's is on showtime, hbo, and cinemax.
rachel| no way, forget it.|joey| c'mon, she's your mom!
chandler| exactly. weekend at bernie's! dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! no?|rachel| chandler, i gotta tell you, i love your mom's books! i love her books! i cannot get on a plane without one! i mean, this is so cool!
chandler| yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'mistress bitch.'|ross| c'mon, chandler, i love your mom. i think she's a blast.
chandler| you can say that because she's not your mom.|ross| oh, please...
paolo| bona sera.|rachel| oh, hi sweetie. 
ross| when did rigatoni get back from rome?|monica| last night.
ross| ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... just a dream i had- but, phew.|phoebe| hey hey hey! she's on!
paolo| ah! nora bing!|jay leno|  ...now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in london? what is that all about?
phoebe| your mom was arrested?|chandler| shhh, busy beaming with pride.
mrs. bing|  ...this is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after i've been intimate with a man...|chandler| now why would she say that's embarrassing?
all| shhh.|mrs. bing|  ...i just get this craving for kung pow chicken.
chandler| that's too much information!!|jay leno|  alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
mrs. bing|  oh, fine. i'm leaving for new york tomorrow, which i hate- but i get to see my son, who i love...|all| awww!
chandler| this is the way that i find out. most moms use the phone.|jay leno|  y'know, don't take this wrong, i-i just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. i don't mean that, i don't mean that bad...
mrs. bing|  oh no, i am a fabulous mom! i bought my son his first condoms.|chandler| ...and then he burst into flames.
monica| let's see. congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.|phoebe| what about glen? he could be a glen. 
monica| nah... not-not special enough.|phoebe| ooh! how about agamemnon?
monica| waaay too special.|mrs. bing| i am famished. what do i want... 
chandler| please god don't let it be kung pow chicken.|mrs. bing| oh, you watched the show! what'd you think?
chandler| well, i think you need to come out of your shell just a little.|ross|  what is this dive? only you could've picked this place.
mrs. bing| oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. gimme a hug.  well, i think we're ready for some tequila.|chandler| i know i am.
mrs. bing| who's doing shots?|monica| yeah.
phoebe| i'm in.|mrs. bing| there y'go. ross?
ross| uh, i'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.|rachel| hi! sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
ross| ...but a man can change. |ross| anyone want me to appraise anything?
rachel| mrs. bing, i have to tell you, i've read everything you've ever written. no, i mean it! i mean, when i read euphoria at midnight, all i wanted to do was become a writer.|mrs. bing| oh, please, honey, listen, if i can do it, anybody can. you just start with half a dozen european cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! you have got yourself a book.
chandler| myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.|mrs. bing| yeah, any messages for room 226?
mrs. bing| you okay there, slugger?|ross| yeah, i'm fine, i'm fine. 
mrs. bing| what is with you tonight?|ross| nothing. nothing nothing nothing.
mrs. bing|  it's the italian hand-licker, isn't it.|ross| no. it's the one he's licking.
mrs. bing| she's supposed to be with you.|ross| you're good.
mrs. bing| oh, ross, listen to me. i have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?|ross| the girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
mrs. bing| no. because i know how to write men that women fall in love with. believe me, i cannot sell a paolo. people will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a paolo. c'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.|ross| when?
mrs. bing| he's not a hero. ...you know who our hero is.|ross| the guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
mrs. bing| no, it's you!|ross| please.
mrs. bing| no, really, c'mon. you're smart, you're sexy...|ross| right.
mrs. bing| you are gonna be fine, believe me.|ross| uh-oh...
joey| uhhhh.... i'll just pee in the street.|ross| hey, is chandler here?
joey| yeah.|ross| okay, uh, about last night, um, chandler.. you didn't tell...  okay, 'cause i'm thinking- we don't need to tell chandler, i mean, it was just a kiss, right? one kiss? no big deal? right?
joey| right. no big deal.|ross| okay. 
joey| in bizarro world!! you broke the code!|ross| what code?
joey| you don't kiss your friend's mom! sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!|chandler| what are you guys doing out here?
ross| uh.. uh.. well, joey and i had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. but, um, apparently, somebody overslept.|joey| yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
ross| no, no i don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.|joey| yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
chandler| okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. |ross| okay, i'm scum, i'm scum.
joey| ross, how could you let this happen?|ross| i don't know, god, i... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? she's, she's sexy, she's...
joey| you don't think my mom's sexy?|ross| well... not in the same way...
joey| i'll have you know that gloria tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? you think it's easy giving birth to seven children?|ross| okay, i think we're getting into a weird area here...
rachel| hey.|ross| hey.

phoebe| no.  no! no! ...so, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?|monica| how would i know? i-i wasn't here.
phoebe| really? not even to, um, change his pajamas?! |chandler| oh my god. 
ross| you're my friend. i-i had to tell you.|chandler| i can't believe it. paolo kissed my mom?
ross| yeah, um, i don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  i can't do this, i did it, it was me, i'm sorry, i kissed your mom.|chandler| what?
ross| i was really upset about rachel and paolo, and i think i had too much tequila, and nora- um, mrs. mom- your bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- but nothing happened, nothing- ask joey, joey, uh, came in-|chandler|  you knew about this?
joey| uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.|chandler| i spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
joey| hey, hey, hey, you're lucky i caught them when i did, or else who knows what woulda happened.|ross| thanks, man, big help.
chandler|  i can't believe this! what the hell were you thinking?|ross| i wasn't- i mean, i-
chandler| y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap i go through with my mom more than you. |ross| i know-
chandler| i can't believe you did this. |ross| chandler-
joey| me neither, y'know what-|chandler| i'm still mad at you for not telling me.

chandler| you gotta let me slam the door! |joey|  see what happens when you break the code?
ross| joey-|joey| ah! 
monica| hey.|rachel| hey.
monica|  'a woman undone, by rachel karen green'. |rachel| yeah. thought i'd give it a shot. i'm still on the first chapter. now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
monica|  yeah, i'd say so. and there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.|phoebe|  hey rach.
rachel| hey.|phoebe| hello.
monica| hello. |phoebe| going to the hospital tonight?
monica| no, you?|phoebe| no, you?

rachel| okay.  i am so hot!|joey|  now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. now you tell me she's not a knockout.
ross| i cannot believe we're having this conversation.|joey| c'mon! just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
rachel|  central perk is proud to present miss phoebe buffay.|phoebe| thanks. hi, um, 'kay. i'd like to start with a song that's about a man that i recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me.  
rachel|  okay, that was phoebe buffay, everybody. woo!|chandler| what was that?
ross| oh, uh, phoebe just started a...|chandler| yeah, i believe i was talking to joey, alright there, mother-kisser? 
joey|  i'll shut up.|ross| chandler, can i just say something? i-i know you're still mad at me, i just wanna say that there were two people there that night. okay? two sets of lips.
chandler| yes, well, i expect this from her. okay? she's always been a freudian nightmare. |ross| okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
chandler| because it's complicated, it's complex- hey, you kissed my mom!|ross|  we're rehearsing a greek play.
chandler| that's very funny. we done now?|ross| no! okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
chandler| that would be no. look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. alright? trust me, you can't talk to her.|ross| okay, 'you' can't, or  still doing the play. aaah!
phoebe| alright, whadyou do with him?|monica| oh! you're awake!
phoebe| look at you! how, how do you feel?|coma guy| uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
monica| you look good!|coma guy| i feel good! ...who are you?
monica| oh, sorry.|phoebe| i'm phoebe buffay.
monica| i'm monica geller. i've been taking care of you.|phoebe| well, we both have.
coma guy| so, the etch-a-sketch is from you guys?|phoebe| well, actually it's just from me.
monica| i got you the foot massager.|phoebe| you know who shaved you? that was me.
monica| i read to you.|phoebe| i sang.  hah!
coma guy| well,... thanks.|monica| oh, my pleasure.
phoebe| you're welcome.|coma guy| so. i guess i'll see you around.
phoebe| what, that's it? |monica| \see you around?\
coma guy| well, what do you want me to say?|monica| oh, i don't know. maybe, um, \that was nice?\ admit something to me? \i'll call you?\ 
coma guy| alright, i'll call you.|phoebe| i don't think you mean that.
monica| this is so typical. y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. and then- we just get nothing back! and then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and \see you around!\ let's go, phoebe.|phoebe| y'know what? we thought you were different. but i guess it was just the coma.
mrs. bing| car's waiting downstairs, i just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. anything you want from lisbon?|chandler| no, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
mrs. bing| alright, well, be good, i love you. |chandler| you kissed my best ross! ...or something to that effect.
mrs. bing|  o-kay. look, it, it was stupid.|chandler| really stupid.
mrs. bing| really stupid. and i don't even know how it happened. i'm sorry, honey, i promise it will never happen again. are we okay now?|chandler| yeah. no. no...
ross| ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.|joey| shh. he did it. he told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
ross| you're kidding.|joey| no, no. he said \when are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?\
ross| wow!|joey| then she came back with \the question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise i have a bomb?\
ross| 'kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say \when are you gonna grow up and realise i am your mom?\|joey| that makes more sense.
ross| so, what's going on now?|joey| i dunno, i've been standing here spelling it out for you! 
ross| whaddya see?|joey| hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. wait, wait. they're walking away... they're walking away... no, no they're not, they're coming right at us! run! run!
mrs. bing| you okay, kiddo?|chandler| yeah, okay.
mrs. bing| alright. |chandler| nice save.
ross|  mrs. bing.|mrs. bing| mr. geller.
chandler| hey.|ross| you mean that?
chandler| yeah, why not.  so i told her.|ross| yeah? how'd it go?
chandler| awful. awful. couldn'ta gone worse. |ross| well, howdya feel?
chandler| pretty good! i told her.|ross| well, see? so, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? huh?  but.. we don't have to go down that road.
rachel| okay. now this is just the first chapter, and i want your absolute honest opinion. oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.|monica| what's a 'niffle'?
joey| you usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.|rachel| alright, alright, so i'm not a great typist...
ross| wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!|rachel| alright, that's it! give it back! that's it!
monica| aunt syl, stop yelling! all i'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, i would have made vegetarian lasagna.  well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.|joey| ross, did you really read all these baby books?
ross| yup! you could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and i can find my way out of there like that! |phoebe| ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. 
chandler| and, we're done with the yogurt. |phoebe| 
monica| aunt syl, i did this as a favor, i am not a caterer. what do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?  you kiss uncle freddie with that mouth?|joey| hey ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?  hi daddy! 
ross|  hello!|joey| 
rachel| honey, you can say it, poconos, poconos, it's like poc-o-nos |paolo| ah, poke 
monica| so, did i hear poconos?|rachel| yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
phoebe| woo-hoo, first weekend away together!|monica| yeah, that's a big step.
rachel| i know...|chandler|  ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
ross| wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? shouldn't it be... flung by now?|rachel| i mean, we are way past the fling thing, i mean, i am feeling things that i've only read about in danielle steele books, you know? i mean, when i'm with him, i'm totally, totally...
ross| ...nauseous, i'm physically nauseous. what am i supposed to do, huh? call immigration?  i could call immigration!|joey| i love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands... 
chandler| ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!|joey| need a new table.
chandler| you think?|carol| hey hey, come on in!
ross| hey, hello! mmwa!  i brought all the books, and monica sends her love, along with this lasagna. |carol| oh great! is it vegetarian, 'cause susan doesn't eat meat.
ross|  i'm pretty sure that it is...|carol| so, i got the results of the amnio today.
ross|  oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....? |carol| totally and completely healthy!
ross| oh, that's great, that is great! |ross| hey, when did you and susan meet huey lewis?
carol| uh, that's our friend tanya.|ross| 
carol| don't you want to know about the sex?|ross| , yaw...
carol| the sex of the baby, ross.|ross| oh, you know the sex of the baby? oh, oh-oh-oh!
carol| do you want to know?|ross| no, no, no, no, no, i don't want to know, absolutely not. i think, you know, i think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!  or isn't...
susan| oh, hello ross!|ross| susan...
susan| so, so, did you hear?|ross| yes, we did, everything's a-ok!
susan| oh, that's so...  it really is...do we know...?|carol| yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
ross|  oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!|susan| oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
carol| mm-hmmm |ross| ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be? 
carol and susan| it's a...|ross|  no, no, no i don't want to know, don't want to know. ok, you know, i should probably, i should probably just go. 
carol| well, thanks for the books.|ross| no problem, ok, mmmwa 
susan| all right, who should we call first, your folks, or deb and rona? |carol| hello?
ross| |chandler| ok, so it's just because it was my table, i have to buy a new one?
joey| that's the rule.|chandler| what rule? there's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
joey| how'd you get to that?|chandler| well, i believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with angela delvecchio
joey| you knew about that?|chandler| well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
joey| ok, ok, how about if we split it?|chandler| what do you mean, like, buy it together?
joey| yeah|chandler| you think we're ready for something like that?
joey| why not?|chandler| well, it's a pretty big commitment, i mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
joey| why, are you moving out?|chandler| i'm not moving out. 
joey| you'd tell me if you were moving out right|chandler| yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate kip...
joey| aw, i know all about kip!|chandler| it's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
joey| well, let me ask you something, was kip a better roommate than me?|chandler| aw, don't do that
phoebe| ok, thanks. |paolo| buon giorno, bella phoebe!
phoebe| oh, paolo, hi, what are you doing here?|paolo| uh, racquela tell me you massage, eh?
phoebe| well, racquela's right, yeah!|phoebe| oh, okay, i don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
paolo| uh, i am, uh, being naked?|phoebe| um, that's really your decision, i mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! you're being naked!
rachel|  i can't believe you don't want to know. i mean, i couldn't not know, i mean, if, if the doctor knows, and carol knows, and susan knows.... |monica| and monica knows...
ross| wha, heh, how could you know, i don't even know!|monica| carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, i asked, she told me.
joey| so what's it gonna be? |ross| waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and i don't know!
monica| i'm sorry, i'm just excited about being an aunt!|joey| or an uncle... 
joey and chandler| hey phoebe!|ross| hi pheebs!
rachel| pheebs!|phoebe| fine!
monica| phoebe, what's the matter?|phoebe| nothing, i'm sorry, i'm just, i'm out of sorts.
customer| hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?|rachel| oh, right, that's me!
joey| hey, chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.|chandler| fine. 
monica| phoebe, what is it?|phoebe| all right, you know paolo?

joey| whoa, store will be open tomorrow!|chandler| more coffee over here, please!
monica| well, what happened?|phoebe| well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. 
joey and chandler| ooooohh!|ross| my god.

monica| was it...?|phoebe| oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.

phoebe| uma thurman.|monica| oh!
ross| the actress!|ross| thanks rach.
chandler| so what are you gonna do?|ross| you have to tell her! you have to tell her! it's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, i think it's a feminist issue! guys? guys? 
chandler| oh, yeah, you have to tell her.|joey| feminist issue. that's where i went!
phoebe| she is gonna hate me.|ross| yeah, well...
joey| will you pick one, just pick one! here, how about that one? |chandler| that's patio furniture!
joey| so what, like people are gonna come in and think, \uh-oh, i'm outside again?\ of course!|chandler|  what about the birds?
joey| i don't know, birds just don't say, \hello, sit here, eat something.\|chandler| you pick one.
joey| all right, how about the ladybugs?|chandler| oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
joey| fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!|chandler| not like that, i won't! 
phoebe| hey!|rachel| hi pheebs!
phoebe| are you moving out?|rachel| no, these aren't all my suitcases.  this one's paolo's.
phoebe| um, um, rachel can we talk for a sec?|rachel| well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause paolo's on his way over.
phoebe| oh!  ok, um, ok, um, |rachel| oh, pheebs, pheebs...
phoebe| ok, um, |rachel|  oh my god, why have i never tasted these before?!
phoebe| oh, i don't make them a lot because i don't think it's fair to the other cookies|rachel| all right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies i've ever had.
phoebe| which proves that i never lie.|rachel| i guess you don't.
phoebe| paolo made a pass at me.|chandler| so, what do you think?
ross| i think it's the most beautiful table i've ever seen.|chandler| i know!
monica| so how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?|joey| who cares, we'll eat at the sink! come on, let's play!
monica| heads up ross!  you suck!|phoebe| are you okay?
rachel| i need some milk.|phoebe| ok, i've got milk  better?
rachel| no...oh, i feel so stupid! oh, i think about the other day with you guys and i was all \oh, paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so...\ oh, god, i'm so embarrassed!|phoebe| i'm so embarrassed, i'm the one he hit on!
rachel| pheebs, if i had never met him this never would have happened!|rachel and phoebe| i'm so sorry! no i'm sorry! no i'm sorry! no i'm sorry! 
phoebe| no, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?|rachel| i don't know...right, he's the pig!
phoebe| such a pig!|rachel| oh, god, he's such a pig, 
phoebe| oh he's like a...|rachel| he's like a big disgusting... 
phoebe| ...like a...|rachel| ...pig...pig man!
phoebe| yes, good! ok...|rachel|  oh, but he was my pig man...how did i not see this?
phoebe|  it's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...|rachel| ok, ok, pheebs...
phoebe| the end.|rachel| oh, god...
phoebe| should i not have told you?|rachel| no, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that i know. uh, i just liked it better before it was better...
phoebe| i think she took it pretty well. you know paolo's over there right now, so...|monica| we should get over there and see if she's okay. 
ross|  ah...ooh! well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.|joey| no-no, she kicked our butts. you could be on the olympic standing-there team.
ross| come on, two on one.|chandler| what are you still doing here? she just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
ross| what, now?|joey| yes, now is when you swoop! you gotta make sure that when paolo walks out of there, the first guy rachel sees is you, she's gotta know that you're everything he's not! you're like, like the anti-paolo!
chandler| my catholic friend is right. she's distraught. you're there for her. you pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of ross! |paolo| no, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
ross|  how's it going?|monica| don't stare. now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , ok, that is either, \how could you?\ or, \enormous breasts!\ here he comes! 
phoebe| ooh!|paolo| uh, i am, uh, to say good-bye.
phoebe| oh, ok bye-bye.|monica| paolo, i really hate you for what you did to rachel,  but i still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
paolo| grazie.|ross| paolo, i-i just want to tell you and i think i speak for everyone when i say... 
phoebe| oh, just look at her... |ross| oh you guys, i-i really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
monica| oh, you're right.|ross|  ...and i really think it should be me.
ross| hey.|rachel| hey.
ross| you all right?|rachel| ooh, i've been better...
ross| come here.  listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, i mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.|rachel| oh, ross...
ross| what?|rachel| i am so sick of guys. i don't want to look at another guy, i don't want to think about another guy, i don't even want to be near another guy. 
ross| huh.|rachel| oh ross, you're so great!
ross| ohhhh |monica| ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
rachel| oh...|phoebe| you ok?
rachel| ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?|phoebe| yep!
ross| see, rach, uh, see, i don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. i really don't. i think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.|rachel| no. i just need to be by myself for a while, you know? i just got to figure out what i want
ross| uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a paolo.|rachel| no, i know, i know, and i'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
ross|  what? |rachel| what?
ross| i-i'm, i'm having a boy?|rachel| uh...no. no, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
ross| wha-i'm having, i'm having a boy!  huh, am i having a boy?|girls| yes, you're having a boy! 
ross| i'm having a boy! oh, i'm having a boy!|chandler| wha-
joey| wha-|joey and chandler| what is it?
ross| i'm having a boy! i-i'm having a boy!|joey| hey!
chandler| hey!|joey and chandler| we already knew that! 
ross| i'm having a son. um...|monica| yes! and that would be a shut-down!
joey and chandler| shut-out!! |monica| where are you guys going? come on, one more game!
joey| uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!|chandler| yeah, get out!
monica| you guys are always hanging out in my apartment! come on, i'll only use my left hand, huh? come on, wussies!  and i'm gone.|chandler|  one more game?
chandler| i'm sorry!|rachel| you have no respect for anybody's privacy!
chandler| rachel, wait, wait.|rachel| no, you wait! this is ridiculous!
chandler| can i just say one thing?|rachel| what? what?!
chandler| that's a relatively open weave and i can still see your... nipular areas.|rachel| oh!!
phoebe| oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. y'know? like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.|roger| that's pretty much it.
phoebe| oops!|roger| but you tell it really well, sweetie.
phoebe| thanks. okay, now go away so we can talk about you.|roger| okay. i'll miss you.
phoebe| isn't he great?|rachel| he's so cute! and he seems to like you so much.
phoebe| i know, i know. so sweet... and so complicated. and for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?|monica| so, you think you'll do it on his couch?
phoebe| oh, i don't know, i don't know. i think that's a little weird, y'know? vinyl.|rachel| okaaay.  any of you guys want anything else?
chandler| oh, yes, could i have one of those. |rachel| no, i'm sorry, we're all out of those. anybody else?
chandler| okay.|roger| did i, uh, did i miss something?
chandler| no, she's still upset because i saw her boobies.|ross| you what? wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
chandler| it was an accident. not like i was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.|rachel| okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
phoebe| yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|rachel| okay, pheebs, i was hoping for more of a change.
chandler| y'know, i don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.|rachel| nice? they were nice. i mean, that's it? i mean, mittens are nice.
chandler| okaaay,  rock, hard place, me.|roger| you're so funny! he's really funny! i wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
chandler| whoah whoah, back up there, sparky. what'd you mean by that?|roger| oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
chandler| huh.|roger| i mean hey! i just met you, i don't know you from adam. ...only child, right? parents divorced before you hit puberty.
chandler| uhhuh, how did you know that?|roger| it's textbook.
joey| hey you guys. hey, you all know my dad, right?|all| hey! hey, mr. trib!
monica| hey, how long are you in the city?|mr. tribbiani| just for a coupla days. i got a job midtown. i figure i'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.  i don't know this one.
phoebe| oh, this is my friend roger.|roger| hi. 
mr. tribbiani| hey, hey. good to meet you, roger.|roger| you too, sir.
mr. tribbiani|  what happened to the, uh, puppet guy?|joey| dad, dad. 
mr. tribbiani| oh, 'scuse me. so ross, uh, how's the wife?  off there too, uh? uh, chandler, quick, say something funny!|mr. tribbiani| gotta go. i miss you too, i love you, but it's getting real late now
joey|  did you know this isn't ma?|mr. tribbiani| her name's ronni. she's a pet mortician. 
joey| sure. so how long you been... |mr. tribbiani| remember when you were a little kid, i used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
joey| since then?!|mr. tribbiani| no, it's only been six years. i just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that i wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...joe. y'ever been in love?
joey| ...i d'know.|mr. tribbiani| then y'haven't. you're burning your tomatoes.
joey| you're one to talk. |mr. tribbiani| joe, your dad's in love big time. and the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
joey| oh man. please tell me one of 'em is ma.|mr. tribbiani| of course, course one of 'em's ma. what's the matter with you.
joey| it's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. he's like actually some spy, working for the c.i.a.  that'd be cool.... this blows!|rachel| i know, i mean, why can't parents just stay parents?  why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
chandler|  what?|rachel| did you not get a good enough look the other day?
ross| alright, alright. we're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. since you saw her boobies, i think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.|chandler| y'know, i don't see that happening?
rachel| c'mon, he's right. tit for tat.|chandler| well i'm not showing you my 'tat.'
monica| hello?|phoebe|  it's phoebe.
roger|  and rog.|monica| c'mon up.
chandler|  oh, good. rog is here.|joey| what's the matter with rog?
ross| yeah.|chandler| oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... i hate that guy.
ross| what, so he was a little analytical. that's what he does, y'know? c'mon, he's not that bad.|ross| y'see, that's where you're wrong. why would i marry her if i thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
roger| i dunno. maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.|ross| why? why would i why? why? why? why?
roger| i don't know. maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...|monica| wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
roger| well, i don't know. i mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.|ross| that that's ridiculous! i don't feel guilty for her failures!
monica| oh! so you think i'm a failure!|phoebe| isn't he good?
ross| nonono, thatthat's not what i was saying...|monica| y'know, all these years, i thought you were on my side. but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to mom and dad so they'd keep liking you better!
ross| hey, i married a lesbian to make you look good!|rachel| you're right! i mean you're right! it wasn't just the weebles, but it was the weeble play palace, and and the weebles' cruise ship. oh, which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in. 
roger| that's tough. tough stuff. c'mon, pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going. |phoebe| oh, okay. feel better, rachel, 'kay?
roger| geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...|phoebe| oh, okay. listen, thanks for everything, mon.
monica| you're welcome.|roger| listen guys, it was great seeing you again. mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? remember, they're just food, they're not love.
monica| hate that guy! |joey| night, you guys.
chandler| oh look, it's the woman we ordered.|joey| hey. can, uh, can we help you?
ronni| oh, no thanks, i'm just waiting for, uh, joey tribbiani.|joey| i'm joey tribbiani.
ronni| oh no, not you, big joey. oh my god, you're so much cuter than your pictures!  i-i'm, i'm ronni....cheese nip?|chandler| uh, joey's having an embolism, but i'd go for a nip, y'know?
ronni| now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. but occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.|chandler| joey, if i go first, i wanna be looking for my keys.
ronni| that's a good one!|mr. tribbiani| hey, joe.
joey| dad, ronni's here.|mr. tribbiani| huh?
ronni| hi.|mr. tribbiani| hey! hello, babe! wh what're what're you doing here?
ronni| oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, i figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting. |mr. tribbiani| thank you. uh...

mr. tribbiani| you're gonna keep an eye on us?|joey| that's right, mister, and i don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. and that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
ronni| wow. he's strict.|joey| now dad, you'll be in my room, ronni uh, you can stay in chandler's room.
ronni| thanks. you're, uh, you're a good kid.|chandler| c'mon, i'll show you to my room. ...that sounds so weird when it's not followed by \no thanks, it's late.\ 
joey| okay. now this is just for tonight. starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. this has gone on long enough.|mr. tribbiani| what kinda change?

joey| just trying to get comfortable. i can't sleep in my underwear. |chandler| well, you're gonna.
joey| i've been thinking. y'know, about how i'm always seeing girls on top of girls...|chandler| are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
joey| y'know what i mean, about how i'm always going out with all these women. and i always figured, when the right one comes along, i'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? now i'm looking at my dad, thinking...|chandler| hey, you're not him. you're you. when they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
joey| no.|chandler| no. you decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. now that wasn't easy, but you did it! and i'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \no thanks, i'm married.\
joey| you really think so?|chandler| yeah. i really do.
joey| thanks, chandler. |chandler| get off!
ronni| hi.|monica| hi...may i help you?
ronni| yeah, uh, joey said i could use your shower, since, uh, chandler's in ours?|monica| okay...who are you?

ronni| thanks.|rachel| hi, i'm rachel.
ronni| hi.|rachel| bathroom's up there.
ronni| great.|rachel| hey, listen, ronni, how long would you say chandler's been in the shower?
ronni| oh, like, uh, five minutes?|rachel| perfect. fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time.  hey, mr. trib. 
mr. tribbiani| hey. morning, dear.|rachel| chandler bing? it's time to see your thing.
joey|  what's the matter with you?!|rachel| i thought it was chandler!
chandler|  what? what?|rachel| you were supposed to be in there so i could see your thing!
chandler| sorry, my my thing was in there with me.|all| hey, pheebs.
phoebe| hey. |monica| how's it going?
phoebe| good. oh oh! roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.|phoebe| so what's going on?
monica| nothing, um, it's just, um... it's roger. |ross| i dunno, there's just something about...
chandler| basically we just feel that he's...|rachel| we hate that guy.
all| yeah. hate him.|ross| we're sorry, pheebs, we're sorry.
phoebe| uh-huh. okay. okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?|all| ...no, we hate him.
rachel| we're sorry.|joey| ma! what're you doing here?
mrs. tribbiani| i came to give you this |joey| oww! big ring!
mrs. tribbiani| why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? things were fine the way they were! there's chicken in there, put it away. for god's sake, joey, really. |joey| hold on, you-you knew?
mrs. tribbiani| of course i knew! what did you think? your father is no james bond. you should've heard some of his cover stories. \i'm sleeping over at my accountant's,\ i mean, what is that? please!|joey| so then how could you i mean, how could you?!
mrs. tribbiani| do you remember how your father used to be? always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. now he's happy! i mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.|joey| ma, i don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! i mean, what about you?
mrs. tribbiani| me? i'm fine. look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like sting. and i'll tell you something else. ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... i mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.|joey| i'm...happy...for you?
mrs. tribbiani| well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. i just want it the way it was.|joey| ma, i'm sorry. i just did what i thought you'd want.
mrs. tribbiani| i know you did, cookie. oh, i know you did. so tell me. did you see her?|joey| yeah. you're ten times prettier than she is.
mrs. tribbiani| that's sweet. could i take her?|joey| with this ring?  no contest.
roger| what's wrong, sweetie?|phoebe| nothing, nothing.
roger| aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. |phoebe| it's, i mean, it's nothing, i'm fine. it's my friends. they-they have a liking problem with you. in that, um, they don't.
roger| oh. they don't.|phoebe| but they don't see all the wonderfulness that i see. they don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. they just think you're a little...
roger| what?|phoebe| intense and creepy. 
roger| oh.|phoebe| but i don't. me, phoebe.
roger| well, i'm not i'm not at all surprised they feel that way.|phoebe| you're not? see, that's why you're so great! 
roger| actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, i'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'oh, define me! define me! love me, i need love!'.|monica| so you talked to your dad, huh.
joey| yeah. he's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that i found out today.|rachel| wow.
chandler| things sure have changed here on waltons mountain.|ross| so joey, you okay?
joey| yeah, i guess. it's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.|rachel| just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
chandler| if i turn into my parents, i'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... i'll end up like my mom.|phoebe|  hey.
all| hey, pheebs.|monica| how's it going?
phoebe| oh, okay, except i broke up with roger.|all| awww.
phoebe| yeah, right.|all| aaawwwwww!!
rachel| what happened?|phoebe| i don't know, i mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways i think he is so right for me, it's just... i hate that guy!
phoebe| hey, joey. what's going on?|joey| clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. next stop: rachel green. 
monica| joey!! what the hell were you doing?!|joey| sorry. wrong boobies.
monica| hello, joey.|mr. tribbiani| oh! ...hello, dear. 
joey| i'm tellin' you ross, she wants you.|ross| she barely knows me. we just live in the same building.
chandler| any contact?|ross| she lent me an egg once.
joey| you're in!|ross| aw, right.
woman| hi, ross.|ross| hey. 
chandler| come on, ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? the rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbiani don't think we need a third... |joey| excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? thanks.
ross| an egg?|joey| yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, \here's your egg back, i'm returning your egg.\
chandler| i think it's winning.|ross| i think it's insane.
chandler| she'll love it. go with the egg, my friend.|joey| think it'll work?
chandler| no, it's suicide. the man's got an egg.|monica| you can not do this.
rachel| do what, do what?|monica| roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
rachel| no! phoebes! don't you remember why you dumped the guy?|phoebe| 'cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on valentine's day!
monica| but phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. i know i do. |rachel| well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
joey| actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.|chandler| oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
joey| no, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. the only reason she's goin' out with me is because i said i could bring a friend for her friend.|chandler| yes, i know, but her friend sounds like such a...
joey| pathetic mess? i know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. i'm thinkin', cha-ching!  thanks. look, you have not been out with a woman since janice. you're doin' this.|ross| hi. she said yes.
chandler| yes! way to go, man!  still got the egg, huh?|joey|  how do i look?
chandler| oh, uh, i... don't... care.  ok, now, remember, no trading. you get the pretty one, i get the mess.|lorraine| hi, joey. well well, look what you brought. very nice.
chandler| ...and what did you bring?|lorraine| she's checking the coats. joey, i'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. will you get me a white zinfandel, and a glass of red for janice.
chandler| janice?|janice| oh.... my.... god.
chandler|  hey, it's janice.|chandler| ok, i'm makin' a break for it, i'm goin' out the window. 
joey| no, no, no, don't! i've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with lorraine. just calm down. |chandler| calm down? calm down? you set me up with the woman that i've dumped twice in the last five months!
joey|  can you stop yellin'? you're makin' me nervous, and i can't go when i'm nervous.|chandler| i'm sorry, i'm sorry, you're right.  come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
rachel| ok, ok, roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to pete carney.|monica| which one was pete carney?
rachel| pete the weeper? remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex.  \was it good for you?\|monica| yeah, well, i'll take a little crying any day over howard-the-\i-win\-guy.  \i win! i win!\ i went out with the guy for two monthsi didn't get to win once.
rachel| how did we end up with these jerks? we're good people!|monica| i don't know. maybe we're some kinda magnets.
phoebe| i know i am. that's why i can't wear a digital watch.|monica| there's more beer, right?
phoebe| oh! you know my friend abby who shaves her head? she said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.|rachel| pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
phoebe| yeah. so, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. it's valentine's day. it's perfect.|monica| ok, well, what kind of ritual?
phoebe| ok. we can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.|rachel| or?
phoebe| or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.|monica| burning's good.
rachel| burning's good. yeah, i got stuff to burn.|lorraine| you know, ever since i was little, i've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
joey| good for you.  uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?|janice| by the way, chandler. i cut you out of all my pictures. so if you want, i have a bag with just your heads.
chandler| that's ok.|janice| oh, are you sure? really? because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
joey|  we can't do that.|chandler|  what? what can't you do?
joey| uh, can i talk to you for a second, over there?|joey| uh, we might be leaving now.
chandler| tell me it's \you and me\ we.|joey| she said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. i'm not even sure what slathering is, but i definitely want to be a part of it.
chandler| ok, you can not do this to me.|joey| you're right, i'm sorry. you're right.
lorraine|  uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|joey| i'm outta here. here's my credit card. dinner's on me. i'm sorry, chandler.
chandler| i hope she throws up on you.|chandler| so...
janice| just us.|chandler| oh, what a crappy night!
janice| although, i have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. |chandler| excuse me.  how ya doin'?
janice| so, do we have the best friends or what?|chandler| joey's not a friend. he's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. another drink? some dessert? a big screen tv?

rachel| oh, joey, look who it is.|joey|  whoa.
chandler| oh, good, joey's home now.|janice| this is so fun. this is like a reunion in the hall.
monica| oh, hi, ross. yeah. there's someone i want you to say hi to.  he just happened to call.|janice| hi, ross. yes, it's me. how did you know?  
ross| i'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from new york to los angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.|kristin| that's funny. who are they?
ross| the blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.|kristin| you mean they're lovers.
ross| if you wanna put a label on it.|kristin| wow, uh, anything else i should know?
ross| nope, nope, that's it. |ross| oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. i always forget that part.  helloo!
phoebe| ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.|monica| all i have is, is oregano and a fresca.
phoebe| um, that's ok!  ok. all right. now we need the semen of a righteous man.|rachel| ok, pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
monica| can we just start throwing things in?|phoebe| ok, yeah, ok.  oh, ok.

chandler| oh, man. in my next life, i'm coming back as a toilet brush.|janice| hello, funny valentine.
chandler| hi, just janice.|janice| hello, joey, our little matchmaker. i could just kiss you all over, and i'm gonna!
joey|  if you don't do it, i will.|ross| so, um, what do you do for a living?
kristin| well, um, for the past few years i've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.|carol| oh no. i thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. 
susan| i thought they could...i'll try to get back as soon as i can. i'm sorry. |ross| now that is funny. hey, do you think...would it be too weird if i invited carol over to join us? 'cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. 
kristin|  i guess.|ross| are you sure? great. carol? wanna come over and join us?
carol| oh, no no no. i'm fine. i'm fine.|ross| come on. these people'll scooch down. you guys'll scooch, won't you? let's try scooching! come on. come on. uh, kristen riggs, this is carol willick. carol, kristin. uh, carol teaches sixth grade. and, kristin, kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
monica| you know, it's a really funny story how this happened.|rachel| really?
janice| i brought you something.|chandler| is it loaded? oh, little candy hearts.  chan and jan forever.
janice| i had them made special.|chandler| ok, janice. janice. hey, janice. look, there's no way for me to tell you this. at least there's no new way for me to tell you this. i just don't things are gonna work out.
janice| that's fine.|chandler|  it is?
janice| mmm-hmm. because i know that this isn't the end.|chandler| oh no, you see, actually it is.
janice| no, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. don't you know it yet? you love me, chandler bing.|chandler| oh, no i don't.
janice| well then ask yourself this. why do you think we keep ending up together? new year's? who invited who? valentine's? who asked who into whose bed? |chandler| i did, but...
janice| you seek me out. something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. janice, janice. you want me. you need me. you can't live without me. and you know it. you just don't know you know it. see ya.|chandler| call me!
carol| it's not true. i never called your mother a wolverine.|ross| you did so. i swear, i swear how long has she been in the bathroom?
carol| uh, i don't think she's in the bathroom. her coat is gone.|ross| well maybe it's cold in there. or maybe i screwed up the first date i had in 9 years. 
carol| that could be it.|ross| oh, god. 
carol| mushroom. smile. they won't all be like this. some women might even stay through dinner. sorry, that's not funny|ross| no, it's just...you know the whole \getting on with your life\ thing. well, do i have to? i mean, i'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. and um, and then i'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and i don't, i don't have to...you know, here's a wacky thought. um, what's say you and i give it another shot? no no no, i know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. but what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? let's just stick a pin in it, ok? because, we're great together, you know. you can't deny it. besides, you're carrying my baby. i mean, how perfect is that? but see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. i love you.
carol| oh, i love you too. but...|ross| no but, no but.
carol| you know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? it's time to take the pin out. you'll find someone, i know you will. the right woman is just waiting for you.|ross| that's easy for you to say, you found one already.
carol| all you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.|carol| not her.
rachel| so, um, will you bring the truck?|rachel| oh, my god.
phoebe| see, there you go, the cleansing works!|monica| they're nice guys.
joey| thank you.|rachel|  
ross| grazie.|rachel| and a nice hot cider for monica. 
monica| aww, thank you.  uh rach?|rachel| yeah?
monica| why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?|rachel| oh! that's why.  i'm sorry!
woman| chandler.|chandler| mrs. tedlock. you're looking lovely today. and may i say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
mrs. tedlock| yes. well, mr. kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.|chandler| oh, listen. if this is about those prank memos, i had nothing to do with them. really. nothing at all. really.  nothing.
phoebe| hey you guys! chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...|chandler| hey!
all| hey!|phoebe| never mind. but it was going to be really good.
ross| what's going on?|all| what is it?
chandler| so, it's a typical day at work. i'm inputting my numbers, and big al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.|all| that's great!
chandler| so.... i quit.|all| why?
chandler| why? this was supposed to be a temp job!|monica| yeah, chandler... you've been there for five years.
chandler| if i took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what i actually do.|phoebe| so was it a lot more money?
chandler| it doesn't matter. i just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the wenus.|rachel| ... the wenus?
chandler| weekly estimated net usage systems. a processing term.|rachel|  oh. that wenus.
joey| so what're you going to do?|chandler| i don't know. that's the thing. i don't know what i want to do. i just know i'm not going to figure it out working there.
phoebe| oooh! i have something you can do! i have this new massage client... steve?  anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.|monica|  um... hi there.
phoebe| hi!  oh, yeah, no, i know. you're a chef. i know, and i thought of you first, but um, chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....|chandler| yeah... i just don't have that much cheffing experience. unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
phoebe|  yeah, yeah! |monica| well, what kind of food is he looking for?
phoebe| well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.|monica|  oh my god!
phoebe| yeah, i know!  so, what do you think?|chandler| thanks, phoebe. but i just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
phoebe| ok.  oh monica! guess what!|chandler| can you see my nipples through this shirt?
rachel| no. but don't worry, i'm sure they're still there.|phoebe| where are you going, mr. suity-man?
chandler| well, i have an appointment to see dr. robert pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  i added the \a-gogo.\|rachel| career counselor?
chandler| hey, you guys all know what you want to do.|rachel| i don't!
chandler| hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. you know, you have goals. you have dreams. i don't have a dream.|ross| ah, the lesser-known \i don't have a dream\ speech.
monica| oh, i love my life, i love my life!|phoebe| ooh! brian's song!
rachel| the meeting with the guy went great?|monica| so great! he showed me where the restaurant's going to be. it's this, it's this cute little place on 10th street. not too big, not too small. just right.
chandler| was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?|monica| so anyway, i'm cooking dinner for him monday night. you know, kind of like an audition. and phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
rachel| what are you going to make?|phoebe|  yummy noises.
rachel|  and monica, what are you going to make?|monica| i don't know. i don't know. it's just going to be so great!
phoebe| ooh! i know what you could make! |ross| hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
joey| how about tony's? if you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.|ross| ok, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
chandler| who are you going out with?|phoebe| oh, is this the bug lady?
rachel|  bzzzz.... i love you, ross.|ross| her name is celia. she's not a bug lady. she's curator of insects at the museum.
rachel| so what are you guys going to do?|ross| oh, i just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and i'd introduce her to my monkey.
chandler| and he's not speaking metaphorically.|joey|  huh-huh?
ross| well, i don't know....  huh-huh.|joey| i'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! she's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
ross| celia, don't worry! don't scream! he's not going to hurt you! soothing tones, celia. soothing tones! marcel...|celia| i can't stand this! he's got his claws in my...
ross| alright... |monica|  ok, try this salmon mousse.
joey|  mmmm. good.|monica| is it better than the other salmon mousse?
joey| it's creamier.|monica| yeah, well, is that better?
joey| i don't know. we're talking about whipped fish, monica. i'm just happy i'm keeping it down, y'know?|rachel| my god! what happened to you?
chandler| eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do i learn?  \you are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.\|phoebe| that's so great! 'cause you already know how to do that!
chandler| can you believe it? i mean, don't i seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? you know, i just always pictured myself doing something...something.|rachel|  oh chandler, i know, i know... oh, hey! you can see your nipples through this shirt!
monica|  here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.|chandler| ooh, you know, i had a grape about five hours ago, so i'd better split this with you.
monica| it's supposed to be that small. it's a pre-appetizer. the french call it an amouz-bouche. |chandler|  well.... it is amouz-ing...
monica| |phoebe| ten dollars an hour for what?
monica| oh, i asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.|rachel|  waitressing?
joey| uh-oh.|monica| well... of course i thought of you! but... but...
rachel| but, but?|monica| but, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? and, well, wendy's more of a... professional waitress.

ross| alright, i've gotta go. c'mon, marcel! c'mon! we're gonna go take a bath. yes we are, aren't we? yes, we are.|chandler| they're still just friends, right?
rachel|  and i will see you tomorrow!|ross| that's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at aunt rachel's, aren't you.
monica| oh, hang on, hang on. does aunt monica get a say in this?|ross| 'pwease, aunt monica, pwease?' oh, unclench. you're not even gonna be there.
chandler| i can't believe we are even having this discussion.|joey| i agree. i'm, like, in disbelief.
chandler| i mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with rachel, they would've happened already?|ross| i'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
joey| she really said that?|ross| well, i added the 'exactly like me' part... but she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
joey| 'tonight' tonight?|ross| well, i think it's perfect. y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
chandler| i can't remember the last time i got a girl to take care of my monkey.|ross| anyway, i figured after work i'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
chandler| hey, y'know what you should do? you should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.|rachel| now, now the one in the feather boa, that's dr. francis. now, she used to be a man. okay, now look, see, there's raven. we hate her. we're glad she's dying. okay- 
joey| how could you lose him?|rachel| i don't know. we were watching tv, and then he pooped in monica's shoe-
monica| wait. he pooped in my shoe? which one?|rachel| i don't know. the left one.
monica| which ones?|rachel| oh. oh, those little clunky amish things you think go with everything.
phoebe|  hey. |all| hi.
phoebe| whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?|chandler| rachel lost marcel.
phoebe| oh no, how?|monica| he- he pooped in my shoe.
phoebe| which one?|monica| those cute little black ones i wear all the time.
phoebe| no, which one? the right or left? 'cause the left one is lucky...|rachel| c'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
joey| alright alright. you're a monkey. you're loose in the city. where do you go?|chandler| okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. i'll go to cats, you go to the russian tea room.
rachel| oh, my, god, c'mon, you guys! he's gonna be home any minute! he's gonna kill me!|monica| okay, we'll start with the building. you guys take the first and second floor, phoebe and i'll take third and fourth.
rachel| well, what'm i gonna do? what'm i gonna do?|monica| okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. spray lysol in my shoe, and wait for ross to kill you.
rachel| anybody wanna trade? oh...|mr. heckles| whaddyou want?
monica| mr. heckles, our friend lost a monkey. have you seen it?|mr. heckles| i left a belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
monica| no!|phoebe| why would you leave your belgian waffle in the hall?
mr. heckles| i wasn't ready for it.|monica| a monkey. have you seen a monkey?
mr. heckles| saw regis philbin once...|phoebe| okay, thank you, mr. heckles. 
mr. heckles| you owe me a waffle.|rachel|  ...with, with russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. okay. thanks.
ross| hey. how did, uh, how'd it go today?|rachel| great! it went great. really great. hey, is that wine?
ross| yeah. you, uh, you want some?|rachel| oh, i would love some. but y'know what? y'know what? let's not drink it here. i'm feeling kinda crazy. you wanna go to newark?
ross| uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the north-east, i was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff?  well-|rachel| oh god, ross, i cannot do this.
ross| okay, quick and painful.  |rachel| oh god... okay. alright. alright. okay. ross, please don't hate me.
ross| oh, what? what-what?|rachel| y'know marcel?
ross| ...yeah?|rachel| well, i kind of... i kind of lost him.
ross|  i- i- i ca- i can't believe this. i mean, all i asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.|rachel| i know, i know, i'm sorry-
ross| no, y'know what, i guess it's partially my fault. y'know, i shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. i should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.|rachel|  oh! who is it?
intercom| animal control.|rachel| see? i've even called animal control!
ross| you called animal control?|rachel| uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
ross| marcel is an illegal exotic animal. i'm not allowed to have him in the city. if they find him, they'll take him away from me.|rachel| o-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
ross| that's right, i.. 'cause i didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!|rachel| hi, thanks for coming.
luisa|  somebody called about a monkey?|rachel| oh, y'know what? that was a complete misunderstanding! 
ross| yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.|rachel| turned out it was a hat.
ross| cat!|rachel| cat! what'm i saying? cat!
monica| hi. we checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen marcel.|luisa| marcel?
ross| my uncle marcel.|phoebe| oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
luisa| oookay. are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?|phoebe| oh my god. you'd put that poor little creature in jail?
monica| pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?|phoebe| yes, but there isn't always time!
monica| look. i'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! um, have a seat. first of all, we haven't been introduced, i'm monica geller.|luisa| oh my god, you are! and you're rachel green!
rachel| yeah!|luisa| luisa gianetti! lincoln high? i sat behind you guys in home room!
rachel| luisa? oh my god! monica! it's luisa!|monica| the luisa from home room!
rachel| yes!!|luisa| you have no idea who i am, do you.
monica| no, none at all.|rachel| none.
luisa| well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. i mean, would it have been so hard to say 'morning, luisa'? or 'nice overalls'?|monica| oh, i'm- i'm so sorry!
luisa| ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems.  but you? what a bitch!|rachel| what?!
monica| be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? y'know, just for old times' sake? go bobcats?|luisa| i could... but i won't. if i find that monkey, he's mine. 
phoebe| dun-dun-duuuur! sorry.|chandler| marcel?
joey| marcel?|chandler| marcel?
joey| marcel?|chandler| um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
joey| a monkey.|chandler| yes have you seen any?
joey| um, sure! did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?|joey| oh. then, no.
chandler| oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.|joey| uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
chandler| yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! and they're very hot.|joey| we can't, alright?  we're sorry. you have no idea how sorry, but... we promised we'd find this monkey. if you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
chandler| okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.|joey| marcel?
chandler| marcel?!|phoebe| marcel?
monica| marcel?|phoebe| marcel?
both| marcel?|phoebe| oh-my-god!
monica| whaaat!|phoebe| something just brushed up against my right leg!
monica| what is it?|phoebe| oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
monica| look, phoebe!|phoebe| yeah! oh, c'mere, marcel! oh, marcel, c'mere!
luisa| step aside, ladies! |monica| what're you gonna do?
luisa| just a small tranquiliser.|monica| run, marcel, run! run, marcel!  are you okay?
phoebe| yeah, think so. oh!  whoah.|monica| oh gosh.
ross| marcel?|rachel| marcel?
ross| marc- oh, this is ridiculous! we've been all over the neighbourhood. he's gone, he's-he's just gone.|rachel| ross, you don't know that.
ross| oh come on. it's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the village.  and now i have a broken foot. i have no monkey, and a broken foot! thank you very much.|rachel| ross, i said i'm sorry like a million times. what do you want me to do? you want me to break my foot too? okay, i'm gonna break my foot, right here.  ow!! oh! oh my god, oh my god! there, are you happy now?!
ross| yeah, yeah. y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! i don't miss marcel any more!|rachel| y'know, it is not like i did this on purpose.
ross| oh, no no no. nono, this is just vintage rachel. i mean, things just sort of happen around you. i mean, you're off in rachel-land, doing your rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...|rachel| ross.
ross| i don't even wanna hear it, you're just...|rachel| ross.
ross| oh, forget it, okay?|rachel| ross!
ross| what? what?|both| hey! hey, bananaman!
phoebe| oh, this is so intense. one side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.|ross| hi, did you order some bananas?
mr. heckles| what about it?|ross| gimme back my monkey.
mr. heckles| i don't have a monkey.|rachel| then what's with all the bananas?
mr. heckles| potassium.|ross| marcel? marcel? okay, where is he? where is he? marcel? marcel?
ross| marcel! what've you done to him?|mr. heckles| that's my monkey. that's patti, patti the monkey.
ross| are you insane? c'mere, marcel, c'mon. |mr. heckles| c'mere, patti. 
ross| c'mere, marcel. |mr. heckles| c'mere, patti. 
luisa|  gotcha.|ross| okay, gimme my monkey back.
mr. heckles| that's my monkey.|luisa| you're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
mr. heckles| that's not my monkey. just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.|ross| alright, i want my monkey.
luisa| no!|rachel| oh, c'mon, luisa!
luisa| sorry, prom queen.|ross|  you had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
rachel| alright. in high school i was the prom queen and i was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! but if you take this monkey, i will lose one of the most important people in my life. you can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. c'mon, luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! take it!|luisa| nope.
rachel| alright. well then how about i call your supervisor, and i tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?|ross| it'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? yes it will.  or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
rachel| y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.|ross| listen, i'm- i'm sorry i was so hard on you before, it's just i...
rachel| oh, ross, c'mon. it's my fault, i almost lost your...|ross| yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? you, you were great. ...hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. you in the mood for, uh, something grape?
rachel| that'd be good.|ross| alright.  well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, i was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, i was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
barry| rachel.|rachel| barry?!
barry| i can't. i can't do it, i can't marry mindy. i think i'm still in love with you.|ross and rachel| oh!
ross| we have got to start locking that door!|monica| this is me in the sound of music. see the von trapp kids?
phoebe| nope.|monica| that's because i'm in front of them.
chandler| eh. i thought that was an alp.|monica| well, high school was not my favourite time.
joey| i dunno, i loved high school. y'know? it was just four years of parties and dating and sex.|chandler| yeah, well i went to boarding school with four hundred boys. any sex i had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
monica| gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?|phoebe| oh. oooh! ooh! ooh!  ooh! my butt cheek is waking up! oooh! ooh!
chandler| i can't believe you would actually say that. i would much rather be mr.peanut than mr.salty.|joey| no way! mr.salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
ross| i don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. they're craaazy.|monica|  oh my god. you guys! you gotta come see this! there's some creep out there with a telescope!
ross| i can't believe it! he's looking right at us!|rachel| oh, that is so sick.
chandler| i feel violated. and not in a good way.|phoebe| how can people do that?...  oh, you guys, look! ugly naked guy got gravity boots!
chandler| i am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. it was unbelievable! we could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...|monica| so have you called her yet?
chandler| let her know i like her? what are you, insane?  i'm right, right?|joey and ross| oh, yeah. yeah. let her dangle.
monica| i can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.|phoebe| oh, god, just do it!  call her! stop being so testosteroney!
chandler| which, by the way, is the real san francisco treat.  i got her machine.|joey| her answer machine?
chandler| no, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.|phoebe| so, uh, why didn't you say anything?
chandler| oh, no-no-no-no. last time i left a spontaneous message i ended up using the phrase \yes indeedy-o.\|monica| look look! it's rachel and barry. no, don't everybody look at once!
ross| okay, okay, what's going on?|phoebe| okay, they're just talking...
ross| yeah, well, does he look upset? does he look like he was just told to shove anything?|phoebe| no, no actually, he's smiling.. and... oh my god, don't do that!!
ross| what? what? what?!|phoebe| that man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  oh!
chandler|  and basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.|all| oh!... right!
chandler| hey rach!|monica| how'd it go?
rachel| y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. he took me to lunch at the russian tea room, and i had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...|phoebe| not a good day for birds...
rachel| then we took a walk down to bendall's, and i told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of chanel...|ross| that's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
rachel| right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? it was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!|ross| that's, that's nice twice!
monica| rachel, what's going on? i mean isn't this the same barry who you left at the altar?|joey| duh, where've you been?
rachel| yeah, but it was different with him today! and he wasn't, like, orthodontist guy, y'know? i mean, we had fun! is there anything wrong with that?|chandler| yes!
rachel| why?|chandler| i have my reasons.
monica| okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?|rachel| all right. all right, all right, all right, all right, i know it's stupid! i will go see him this afternoon, and i will just put an end to it!
rachel| wow... wow!|barry| yeah.
rachel| i'm not crazy, right? i mean, it was never like that.|barry| nooo, it wasn't.
rachel| ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...|chandler|  oh god!
monica| that's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!|chandler| hey, i've been honing!
ross| what was with the dishes?|chandler| oh, uh.. i want her to think i might be in a restaurant.. y'know? i might have some kind of life, like i haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
monica|  look look! he's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!|phoebe| oh my god!  stop looking in here!
monica| great, now he's waving back.|joey| man, we gotta do something about that guy. this morning, i caught him looking into our apartment. it creeps me out! i feel like i can't do stuff!
monica| what kinda stuff?|joey| will you grow up? i'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when i'm cooking naked.
phoebe| you cook naked?|joey| yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
chandler| what are you looking at me for? i didn't know that.|barry| what's the matter?
rachel| oh, it's just... oh, barry, this was not good.|barry| no, it was. it was very very good.
rachel| well, what about mindy?|barry| oh, way, way better than mindy.
rachel| no, not that, i mean, what about you and mindy?|barry| well, if you want, i'll justi'll just break it off with her.
rachel| no. no-no-no-no, no. i mean, don't do that. not, i mean not for me. |bernice|  dr. farber, bobby rush is here for his adjustment.
barry|  let's go away this weekend.|rachel| oh, barry..! come on, this is all way too..
barry| we can, we can go to aruba! when i went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. you would've liked it.|rachel| i had a bra.
bobby| hey, dr. farber.|barry| all right miss green, everything looks fine... yep, i think we're starting to see some real progress here.
rachel| what?!|bobby| i'm twelve, i'm not stupid.
chandler| can i use your phone?|monica| yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
chandler| yes, it's working! why isn't she calling me back?|joey| maybe she never got your message.
phoebe| y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.|chandler| y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
ross| ...desperate, needy, pathetic?|chandler| ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
phoebe| how many beeps?|chandler| she answered.
monica| y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.|chandler| i'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. now i'm needy and snubbed. god, i miss just being needy.
all| hey! hi!|phoebe| how'd he take it?
rachel| pretty well, actually... |monica|  uh, rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
rachel| oh, do i?|monica| uh huh.
rachel|  we ended up having sex in his chair.|monica| you had sex in his chair?!... i said that a little too loudly, didn't i?
ross| you-you had what?|phoebe| sex in his chair.
ross| what, uh... what were you thinking?|rachel| i don't know! i mean, we still care about each other. there's a history there. 's'like you and carol.
ross| no! no no, it is nothing like me and carol!|rachel| please. if she said to you, \ross, i want you on this couch, right here, right now,\ what would you say? 
chandler| if it helps, i could slide over.|ross| it's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! it's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- i gotta go.
phoebe| where are you going?|ross|  i just have to go, all right? do i need a reason? huh? i mean i have things to do with my life, i have a jam packed schedule, and i am late- for keeping up with it. okay?
chandler| hello? hello?|rachel|  oh god. oh god. oh god.
chandler| so how's mindy?|rachel| oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...oh, she sounded really weird, i gotta call barry...  hi, it's me, i just.. mindy!! mindy! hi! no, i figured that's where you'd be!
monica| brrrrrrr!|chandler| hell is filled with people like you.
joey|  he's back! the peeper's back!|joey|  get down!
rachel| get down?|chandler| ...and boogie!
rachel| thanks, but i gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by mindy.|monica| relax. y'know, she may not even know.
rachel| please. i haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? i mean, what else is it about? oh! she was my best friend, you guys! we went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..|joey|  yeah?
rachel| and now, y'know, i'm like... i'm like the other woman! i feel so..|joey| ..naughty!
rachel| right, i'll see you guys later...|joey| oh, hold up, i'll walk out with you. now, rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or-  that's fine, yeah...
chandler| okay, i'm gonna go to the bathroom. will you watch my phone?|monica| why don't you just take it with you?
chandler| hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?|monica| why don't you just call her?
chandler| i can't call her, i left a message! i have some pride.|monica| do you?
chandler| no!  she's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...|monica| don't you have to pee?
chandler| 's'why i'm dancing...|rachel| mindy.
mindy| hey, you.|rachel| hey, you.... so, what's up?
mindy| um.. we should really be sitting for this.|rachel| sure we should... so.
mindy| now, i know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... except for maybe laurie schaffer, who i don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....okay, i'm just gonna ask you this once, and i want a straight answer.|rachel| okay.
mindy| will you be my maid of honour?|rachel| of course!
mindy| oh that's so great!|rachel| was that all you wanted to ask me?
mindy| that's all!|rachel| ohhhh!!  ...what? what?
mindy| that's not all.|rachel| oh sure it is!
mindy| oh no, it isn't! no! i think barry is seeing someone in the city.|rachel| um, what- what would make you think that?
mindy| well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like chanel.|rachel|  really. mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when i was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
mindy| oh god! you see, that's what i was afraid of!|rachel| what? what's what you were afraid of?
mindy| okay, okay... when barry was engaged to you, he and i...kind of... had a little thing on the side.|rachel| what?
mindy| i know. i know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said \don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to rachel,\ and now i feel so stupid.|rachel| uh... oh, mindy, you are so stupid. oh, we are both so stupid.
mindy| what do you mean?|rachel|  smell familiar?
mindy| oh no.|rachel| oh, i am so sorry.
mindy| no me, i am so sorry...|joey|  oh my.

barry| i'm sorry... i'm sorry, god, i am so sorry, i'm an idiot, i was weak, i couldn't help myself! whatever i did, i only did because i love you so much!|rachel| uh- which one of us are you talking to there, barr?
barry| ....mindy. mindy, of course mindy, it was always mindy.|rachel| even when we were having sex in that chair?
barry|  i swear, whatever i was doing, i was always thinking of you.|rachel| please! during that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
mindy|  you did it twice?|rachel| well, the first time didn't really count... i mean, y'know, 's'barry.
mindy| okay...|barry|  sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. we'll go back to aruba.
bernice|  dr. farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...jason costalano is choking on his retainer.|barry| oh god...  look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? i'll be, i'll be right back.
rachel| okay. okay, we'll be here! hating you! did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? listen honey, if i'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because i'm telling you, this feels great.|mindy| yeah... i'm pretty sure i'm still gonna marry him.
rachel| what are you talking about?! mindy, the guy is the devil! he's satan in a smock!|mindy| look, i know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, i still really wanna be mrs. dr. barry farber, d.d.s.
rachel| oh god. |mindy| i hope you can find some way to be happy for me. and i hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
rachel| and i hope barry doesn't kill you and eat you in aruba.|monica| you okay?
rachel| yeah.|monica| really?
rachel| yeah! y'know, ever since i ran out on barry at the wedding, i have wondered whether i made the right choice. and now i know.|monica| aww... 
joey| big day.|joey| all right, i'll give you this, mr. peanut is a better dresser. i mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
phoebe| you know he's gay?|ross| i just wanna clarify this: are you outing mr. peanut?
danielle|  chandler?|chandler| danielle! hi! uh- everybody, this is danielle, danielle, everybody.
all| hi. hi.|chandler| what are you doing here?
danielle| well, i've been calling you, but it turns out i had your number wrong. and when i finally got the right one from information, there was no answer. so i thought i'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.|chandler| ...i'm, i'm okay.
danielle| listen uh, maybe we could get together later?|chandler| that sounds good. i'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
danielle| you got it.|chandler| okay.
danielle| g'bye, everybody.|all| bye.
phoebe| whoo-hoo!|monica| yeah, there you go!
ross| second date!|chandler| ...i dunno.
rachel| you don't know?!|chandler| well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if i was okay? i mean,... how needy is that?
joey| how could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|monica| i have no idea. but look how much they spent!
rachel| monica, would you calm down? the credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.|monica| i know. it's just such reckless spending.
ross| i think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.|chandler| wow, what a geek. they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop.
monica| that's me.|phoebe| oh! the yuk! ross, he's doing it again! 
ross| marcel, stop humping the lamp! stop humping! now marcel, come back-  come here, marcel-|rachel| oh no, not in my room! i'll get him.
monica| ross, you've got to do something about the humping.|ross| what? it's, it's just a phase.
chandler| well, that's what we said about joey...|ross| would you all relax? it's not that big a deal.
rachel|  stop it! marcel! bad monkey!|ross| what?
rachel| let's just say my curious george doll is no longer curious.|rachel| oh, monica. you are not still going over that thing.
monica| this woman's living my life.|rachel| what?
monica| she's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! look at this, look. she buys tickets for plays that i wanna see. she, she buys clothes from stores that i'm intimidated by the sales people. she spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.|rachel| you're not an artist.
monica| yeah, well i might be if i had the supplies! i mean, i could do all this stuff. only i don't.|rachel| oh, monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
monica| oh really? okay, let's compare, shall we.|rachel|  oh, it's so late for 'shall we'...
monica| do i go horseback riding in the park? do i take classes at the new school?|rachel|  nooo...
monica| this is so unfair! she's got everything i want, and she doesn't have my mother.|chandler| how about joey... pepponi?
joey| no, still too ethnic. my agent thinks i should have a name that's more neutral.|chandler| joey... switzerland?
joey| plus, y'know, i think it should be joe. y'know, joey makes me sound like i'm, i dunno, this big.  which i'm not.|chandler| joe...joe...joe...stalin?
joey| stalin...stalin...do i know that name? it sounds familiar.|chandler| well, it does not ring a bell with me...
joey|  joe stalin. y'know, that's pretty good.|chandler| might wanna try joseph.
joey| joseph stalin. i think you'd remember that!|chandler| oh yes! bye bye birdie, starring joseph stalin. joseph stalin is the fiddler on the roof.
rachel| hey.|phoebe| hey.
monica| hi.  hi, uh, yes, this is monica geller. um, i believe i'm taking some classes with you and i was wondering what they were.|phoebe| what are you doing?
monica|  i'm going to tap class.|rachel| what, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
monica| this woman's got my life, i should get to see who she is.|rachel| go to the post office! i'm sure her picture's up! ...okay, monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! i mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
phoebe| this is madness. it's madness, i tell you, for the love of god, monica, don't do it!! ...thank you.|monica| what d'you think?
phoebe| lotsa things.|rachel| which one do you think she is?
teacher| may i help you?|monica| oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
teacher| you don't observe a dance class. you dance|rachel| what does she mean?
phoebe| i think she means  'you dance|monica| okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
teacher|  people! last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. let's not have that happen again!|rachel| she could be you.
teacher| let's get started. five, six, a-five six seven eight...|monica| okay, i'm not getting this!
phoebe|  i'm totally getting it!|monica| did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
rachel| what? you just click when they click.|teacher| alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
phoebe| okay. and, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. i'm with rachel.|monica| great. it's gym class all over again.
phoebe and rachel| aww.|teacher| well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
monica| why don't i just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.|woman| it's okay, it's okay, i'm here, i'm here. sorry i'm late, okay, here i am. who's the new tense girl?
teacher| she's your partner.|woman| hi. i'm monica.
monica| oh. monica! ...hi. i'm mo- ...nana.|woman|  monana?
monica| yeah. it's dutch.|fake monica| you're kidding! i-i spent three years in amsterdam. 
monica| um, pennsylvania dutch.|teacher| and we're dancing. a-five, six, seven, eight...
ross|  hi.|chandler and joey| hey.
joey| where've you been?|ross| at the vet.
chandler| she's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?|ross| she says marcel's humping thing's not a phase. apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
joey|  hey! he beat ya.|ross| she says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
chandler| so what does this mean?|ross| i'm gonna have to give him up.
joey| i can't believe it, ross. this sucks!|chandler| i don't get it, i mean, you just got him. how can he be an adult already?
ross| i know. i know. i mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing i can't get off my leg.|joey| isn't there any way you can keep him?
ross| no, no. the vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. i've just gotta get him into a zoo.|joey| how do you get a monkey into a zoo?
chandler| i know that one! ...no, that's popes into a volkswagen.|ross| well, we're applying to a lot of them. naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, san diego... right? but that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at miami, so that's a possibility.
chandler| yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. i mean, it's a total party zoo.|phoebe| hey. we found her, we found the girl.
chandler| what?|joey| did you call the cops?
rachel| nope. we took her to lunch.|chandler| ah. your own brand of vigilante justice.
ross| what?! are you insane? this woman stole from you. she stole. she's a stealer.|monica| y'know what? after you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. i mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
ross| yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.|chandler| ...take off their hats!
phoebe| popes in a volkswagen! ...i love that joke.|rachel| no way. no way did you do this.
fake monica| monana was very brave.|monica| it was so wild. we told them we were the gunnersens in room six fifteen. only to find out the boston celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
fake monica| so once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...|monica| ...they threw us out! i was thrown out of a hotel! me!
rachel| go monana! well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. i get to go pour coffee for people i don't know. don't wait up. |fake monica| oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a broadway show.
monica| 'scuse me?|fake monica| there's an open call for cats. i'm thinking we go down there, sing memories and make complete fools of ourselves. whaddya say?
monica| nononononono. think who you're dealing with here. i mean, i'm not like you. i-i can't even stand in front of a tap class.|fake monica| well, that's just probably 'cause of your amish background.
monica| what?|fake monica| well, you're pennsylvania dutch, right?
monica| right. till i bought a blow dryer, then i was shunned.|fake monica| i-i used to be just like you. and then one day i saw a movie that changed my life. did you ever see dead poets' society?
monica| uh-huh.|fake monica| i thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. i mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? what was that?! it's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. i walked out of there and i thought, 'now, that's two hours of my life that i'm never getting back.' and that thought scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do.
monica| wow. then i would definitely not recommend mrs. doubtfire.|ross|  that was like our safety zoo. they take like dogs and cows. see? i don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
phoebe| i'd say that chair's taking the brunt.|ross| marcel! marcel! marcel, no! good boy. see, how can nobody want him?
rachel| oh, somebody will.|joey|  you know there already is a joseph stalin?
chandler| you're kidding.|joey| apparently he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. you'd think you would've known that!
chandler| y'know, you'd think i would've.|joey| phoebe. whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
phoebe| ...flame boy.|ross| where exactly is your zoo?
dr. baldhara| well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, marcel?|ross| yes.
dr. baldhara| does he, uh, fight with other animals?|ross| no-no, he's, he's very docile.
dr. baldhara| even if he were... cornered?|ross| well i, i don't know. why?
dr. baldhara| uh, how is he at handling small objects?|ross| he can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
dr. baldhara| how about a hammer, or a small blade?|ross| why- why- why would he need a blade?
dr. baldhara| well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. otherwise it's just cruel.|chandler and joey| he- he- he got in, he- he got in to san diego.
joey| we, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...|chandler| ...he's in.
ross| he's in! oh, did you hear that, marcel? san diego. san diego!|dr. baldhara| you're making a big mistake here. i mean, san diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, i'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
monica| yo- hooo!|rachel| where the hell've you been?
monica| monica and i just crashed an embassy party.|rachel| are you drunk?!
monica| noooo!  i'm lying. i am so drunk.|rachel| oh god, oh. great, monica, y'know what, you could've called, i have been up here, i've been worried...
rachel| monica? monica!|monica| water rules!
rachel| yes, yes, it does. okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?|monica| nope. going to the big apple circus today.
rachel| okay monica, what are you doing? you're gonna lose your job! this is not you!|monica| no, it is me! y'know, i'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! y'know, when i'm with her, i am so much more than that. i'm- i'm monana!
rachel| hello? yes, she is, hold on a second, please. monana, it's for you, the credit card people.|monica| helloooo? yeah. oh my god. thanks.
rachel| what?|monica| they've arrested monica.
monica| hi.|fake monica| hey.
monica| how are you?|fake monica| i'm not too bad. fortunately, blue's my colour. how-how did you know i was here?
monica| because... i'm monica geller. it was my credit card you were using.|fake monica| that i was not expecting.
monica| i want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.|fake monica| oh. thanks.
monica| no, thank you! you have given me so much! i mean, if it wasn't for you, i would never have gotten to sing memories on the stage at the wintergarden theater!|fake monica| well, actually, you only got to sing 'memo-'.
monica| i just can't believe you're in here. i mean, what am i gonna do without you? who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? who's gonna take me to the big apple circus?|fake monica| monica, i started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the big apple circus?
monica| well, not... worried, just... wondering.|fake monica| there's nothing to wonder about, monica. you're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
monica| not necessarily...|fake monica| yes necessarily! i mean, i dunno what it is, maybe it's the amish thing.
monica| um, i'm not actually amish.|fake monica| really? then why are you like that?
teacher| you by the door. in or out?|monica| in. 
teacher| you in the back, you're getting it all wrong!|monica| yeah, but at least i'm doing it!
pa| this is the final boarding call for flight 67 to san diego, boarding at gate 42a.|phoebe| okay. good-bye, little monkey guy. alright, i wrote you this poem. okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
ross| aww. thank you, aunt phoebe.|phoebe| oh!
chandler| okay, bye, champ. now, i know there's gonna be a lot of babes in san diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.|joey| i dunno what to say, ross. uh, it's a monkey.
ross| just, just say what you feel.|joey| marcel, i'm hungry.
ross| that was good.|rachel|  marcel, this is for you. it's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
ross| uh, if you guys don't mind, i'd like to take a moment, just me and him.|all| oh, sure. sure, absolutely. 
ross| marcel, c'mere, c'mere.  okay, marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! marcel, would- okay, just take him away. just take him.|actor|  oh, that i were a glove upon that hand, that i might... touch thy cheek...
joey| hi, uh, i'll be reading for the role of mercutio.|joey| holden mcgroin.
monica| tell him.|rachel| no.
phoebe| tell him, tell him.|monica| just...please tell him.
rachel| shut up!|chandler| tell me what?
monica| look at you, you won't even look at him.|chandler|  oh, come on tell me. i could use another reason why women won't look at me.
rachel| all right, all right, all right. last night, i had a dream that, uh, you and i, were...|phoebe| doing it on this table. 
chandler| wow!|joey| exellent dream score.
ross| why, why, why would you dream that?|chandler| more importantly, was i any good?
rachel| well, you were pretty damn good.|chandler| interesting, cause in my dreams, i'm allways surprisingly inadequate. 
rachel| well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.|ross| i love it, when we share.
chandler| you're okay there?|ross| i can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
chandler| i'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. i was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.|chandler| hello rachel.
rachel| get off.|phoebe|  uh, uh, gimme. can you see me operating a drill press?
joey| i don't know. what are you wearing?|ross| pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
phoebe| just for some short-term-work. you know, until i get back some of my massage clients.|chandler| pirates again?
phoebe| no, nothing like that. i was just...such a dummie. i taught this \massage-yourself-at-home-workshop.\ and they are.|joey| hey, hey, chan. she could work for you.
chandler|  thanks joey, that's a good idea.|phoebe| what... i could, i could do it. what is it?
chandler| well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. she is having one of her boobs redused.  it's a whole big boob story.|phoebe| i could be a secretary.
chandler| well, you know phoebs. i don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. for a large portion of the day.|phoebe| i could do that.
rachel| what are you playing with?|ross| oh, it's my new beeper.
joey| what the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?|monica| is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
ross| no, it's for when carol goes into labor. she can get me wherever i am. i mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-jimbo.|chandler| a cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
monica| all right, i'll see you guys later. |rachel| off to see young ethan?
monica| thank you.|joey| how young is young ethan? young?

monica| okay, he's a senior in college.|ross| college?
chandler| whoa! and this manchild has no problem with how old you are?|monica| no, of course not. it's not even an issue. cause i told him i was 22.
all| what?|monica| oh, i can't pass for 22?
phoebe| well, maybe 25-26.|monica| i am 26.
phoebe| there you go.|chandler| can you hear that?

monica| what?|rachel| could tonight be the night?
monica| i don't know. look he's a great guy and i love being with him but... you know. things happen, and they happen. you don't plan these things.|rachel| so, did you shave your legs?
monica| yeah.|rachel| a-ha!
joey| would you let it go ross. it was just a dream. it doesn't mean...|ross| oh, oh. oh, oh. oh this is it. oh my god it's baby time. baby time.

joey| services?  oh, services.|ross|  all rightie, bye bye.
joey| hey, hey. how was the first day?|phoebe| oh, exellent. everyone was so, so nice.
chandler| see, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes.  me.|phoebe| no, i didn't tell anybody that i knew you.
chandler| why not?|phoebe| oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
chandler| what?!|phoebe| i thought you knew that.
chandler| noho. who doesn't they like me?|phoebe| everyone. except for uh... no everyone.
chandler| what are you talking about?|phoebe| don't feel bad. you know they used to like you a lot. but then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like \mr. boss man\. you know, mr. bing. mr. bing, \boss man bing\.
chandler| i can't belive it.|phoebe| yeah, yeah. they even do you.
chandler| they do me?|phoebe| you know like... uh okay... uh... 'could that report be any later?'
chandler| i don't sound like that.|ross| oh, oh chandler...
joey| oh... yeah, you do.|ross| 'the hills were alive with the sound of music.'
joey|  my scones.|chandler| okay, i don't sound like that. that is so not true.
chandler| that is so not... that is so not... that... oh, shut up!|monica| did not.
young ethan| i am telling you, up until i was, like nine, i thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.|monica| how was that possible?
young ethan| well, think about it. it's always on the news. 'a man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' and i just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there?  oh, ah. i should go.|monica| okay.
young ethan| okay.|monica| unless...
young ethan| what?|monica| uh, ah. unless you wanna stay over? i mean, i'm going to, so...
young ethan| yeah, i'd really like that.|young ethan| uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
monica| okay, is this like 'i have an early class tomorrow' or 'i'm secretly married to a goat?'|young ethan| well it's somewhere in between. you see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, i'm not uh..., well i, i mean i haven't ever uh...
monica| ethan?|young ethan| yeah?
monica| are you a virgin?|young ethan| well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes i am. i uh, i've kinda been waiting for the right person.
monica| really?|young ethan| yeah. you do know i was talking about you, right?
young ethan| wow!|monica| you keep saying that.
young ethan| you know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.|monica| listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. and i, i-i figured if you could be honest, then i can to.
young ethan| oh god, don't tell me, i did it wrong.|monica| no-no. nothing wrong about that. 
young ethan| oh.|monica| um, okay, here it goes. i'm not 22. i'm, i'm 25... and thirteen months. 
young ethan| huh!|monica| but i figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. i mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
young ethan| uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, i have another one for you. i'm a little younger than i said.|monica| you're not a senior?
young ethan| oh, i'm a senior... in high school.|monica| ok...ay.
monica| what we did was wrong. oh god, i just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the bicentennial.|young ethan| i just had sex.
monica| ethan, focus. how could you not tell me?|young ethan| well, you never told me how old you were.
monica| well, that's different. my lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. what were you thinking?|young ethan| i wasn't thinking. i was too busy fallin'...
monica| don't say it. |young ethan| ...in love with you.
monica| really?|young ethan|  sorry.
monica| well,fall out of it. you know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. oh god, oh god. i'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named chad. i'm joan collins.|young ethan| who? 
ross|  just easier that way.|chandler| oh, come on. you told me about the last dream.
rachel| no, forget it.|chandler| oh, why not. was i doing anything particularly... saucy?
rachel| all right, fine. um, you were not the only one there.  joey was there too.|joey| all right. 
ross| was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.|rachel| no.
ross| you're sure? nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?|rachel| no, it was just the three of us.
ross| huh!|joey| so, tell me. was it like you and chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and chandler?
rachel|  you know what?|joey| what?
rachel| there were times when it wasn't even me.|phoebe| that is so sweet, you guys. 
rachel| mon, ethan called again. mon?|all|  mon!
monica| what?|rachel| ethan called again.
monica| oh.|ross| are you not seeing him anymore?
monica| no. you know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.|chandler| and this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
rachel| i, i didn't say any... i sw... i did not say anything, i swear. he stopped by.|joey| listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest power ranger is?
ross| oh, yeah.|monica| ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. could we drop it now?
ross| it's morphin time!|joey| stegosaurus!
chandler| tyrannosaurus!|phoebe| ooh, oh, i've gotta go.  cool!
rachel| where are you going?|phoebe| um, oh, i've got a birthday party, with some work people.
chandler| work people? nobody told me.|phoebe| no, i know. that's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
chandler| you know, i don't get this. a month ago, these people were my friends. you know, just because i'm in charge doesn't mean i'm a different person.|phoebe| well, then you should come tonight. you know, just hang out with them. let them see what a great guy you still are.
chandler| you think i should?|phoebe| i really do, yeah.
chandler| okay.|phoebe| okay.
chandler| okay.|phoebe| oh, but, could we not go together? i,i don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
chandler| i think last night was great. you know, the karaoke thing. tracy and i doing ebony and ivory.|phoebe| you were great. but they still made fun of you.
chandler| what?|phoebe| you know, now you're more like, you know like, \mr. caring boss,\ \mr.\, you know, \i'm one of you, boss,\ \mr., i wanna be your buddy, boss man bing!\
chandler| then, i don't get it.|phoebe| well, you know what chandler? i think you've gotta face it. you're like, the guy in the big office, you know. you're the one that hires them, that fires them... they still say you're a great boss.
chandler| they do?|phoebe| uh huh. but they're not your friends anymore.
chandler| i just wan't to...|phoebe| no, but you can't.
chandler| but i just wa...|phoebe| uh uh.
monica| aren't you gonna...|ross| oh, carol and i have a new system. if she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise i just ignore it.
joey| what about andr?|ross| oh, well this morning he got a call from who i think was our cousin nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than i needed to know.
young ethan| hey.|monica| that was gonna be my opener.

dr. franzblau| i don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. so, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?|rachel|  no, no, not at the moment, no, i'm not. are you?
dr. franzblau| no, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.|rachel| right, yeah, i've heard that about cute doctors.
dr. franzblau| no, no, really. i suppose it's because i spend so much time, you know, where i do.|rachel| oh.
dr. franzblau| i try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what i do. it's like uh...well, for instance, what do you do?|rachel| i'm a waitress.
dr. franzblau| ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if i see one more cup of coffee'...|rachel|  yeah. gotcha.
dr. franzblau| i'm gonna go check up on your friend.|rachel| ok. that's fine. 
lydia| so how did you know i was even here?|guy| your mom called me. so is this her?
lydia| no, this is a loaner.|guy| i'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
lydia| i wasn't by myself. i had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  so, did you see who won the game?|guy| yeah, the knicks by 10. they suck.
lydia| yeah, they're not so bad.|ross| come on, come on. damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.  this is all your fault. this is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? my son is being born, and i should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
susan| the woman i love is having a baby today. i've been waiting for this just as much as you have.|ross| no no no, believe me. no one has been waiting for this as much as i have, ok? and you know what the funny thing is? when this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? where does that leave me?
susan| you get to be the baby's father. everyone knows who you are. who am i? there's mother's day, there's father's day, there's no... lesbian lover day.|ross| every day is lesbian lover day.
phoebe| this is so great.|ross| you wanna explain that?
phoebe| i mean, well, 'cause when i was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so i barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. and here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. and it's not even born yet. it's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.  i'm sorry, you were fighting.|carol| where are they?
monica| i'm sure they'll be here soon.|rachel| yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
joey| relax. you're only at nine centimeters. and the baby's at zero station.|chandler|  you are really frightening me.
chandler| somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  anybody seen a nipple?|dr. franzblau| all right, ten centimeters, here we go.
nurse| all right, honey, time to start pushing.|carol| but they're not here yet!

ross| we're here!|carol|  where have you been?
ross| long story, honey.|dr. franzblau| all right, carol, i need you to keep pushing. i need excuse me, could i have this?
nurse| all right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!|all| good luck!
chandler|  let me ask you, do you have to be carol's lesbian life partner?|nurse| out!

phoebe| jeez, you say one thing, and...|monica| you're going to china?
ross| yeah, i-it's for the museum. someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so i'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. anyway, i'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. so here's my itinerary |phoebe| oh, let me see!

ross| no no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. do you guys know who carl is?|chandler| uh, let's see... alvin... simon... theodore.... no.
ross| well, rachel's having drinks with him tonight.|joey| oh no! how can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
chandler| forget about her.|joey| he's right, man. please. move on. go to china. eat chinese food.
chandler| course there, they just call it food.|ross| yeah... i guess. i don'ti don't know. alright, just... just give her this for me, ok? 
joey| listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.|ross| i know.
joey| we want you to be happy. and i may only have a couple beers in me, but... i love you, man. |chandler| i'm still on my first. i just think you're nice.
melanie| anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. we call ourselves 'the three basketeers.'|joey| like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
chandler| |monica|  ok, how does everybody like their burgers?
rachel| oh, no, no, no. presents first. food later. |monica| hey, hold on there, tiger. how's it going? how you holding up?
joey| well, not so good. she definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what i...|joey| then you do. heh, heh.
monica| so, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?|joey| what do you mean?
monica| y'know, just be there for her.|joey| not following you.
monica| think about it.|rachel| ok, i'm guessing this is from...
rachel| well, thank you, melanie.|chandler|  ok, this one right here is from me.
rachel| |rachel| this one's from joey... feels like a book. thinks it's a book... feels like a book. and......it's a book!
phoebe| oh, it's dr. seuss!|joey| : that book got me through some tough times.
melanie| there is a little child inside this man!|chandler| yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
rachel| who's this from?|chandler| oh, that's ross's. 
rachel| oh...  oh my god. he remembered.|phoebe| remembered what?
rachel| it was like months ago. we were walking by this antique store, and i saw this pin in the window, and i told him it was just like one my grandmother had when i was a little girl. oh! i can't believe he remembered!|chandler| well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? 
phoebe| oh, it's so pretty. this must have cost him a fortune.|monica| i can't believe he did this.
chandler| come on, ross? remember back in college, when he fell in love with carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?|rachel| what did you just say?
chandler|  ahem... um... crystal duck.|rachel| no, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
chandler|  f-hah.... flennin....|rachel| oh.... my god.
chandler|  oh, no-no-no-no-no....|joey|  that's good, just keep rubbing your head. that'll turn back time.
rachel| i mean, this is unbelievable.|phoebe| i know. this is really, really huge.
chandler| no it's not. it's small. it's tiny. it's petite. it's wee.|phoebe| nuh-uh. i don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
chandler| ok, is there a mute button on this woman?|monica| i think this is so great! i mean, you and ross! d-did you have any idea?
rachel| no! none! i mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so i just... : w-well, what else did he say? i mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?|joey| well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
rachel| ross? all this time? well, i've got to talk to him. |chandler|  h-he's in china!
joey| the country.|monica| no, no, wait.  his flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
chandler| what about the time difference?|monica| from here to the airport?
chandler| yes!  you're never gonna make it!|monica| rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
rachel| i-i-i don't know.|chandler| well then maybe you shouldn't go. 
joey| he's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.|monica| yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
rachel| i don't know. maybe i'll know when i see him.|phoebe| here, look, alright, does this help?
rachel| noooo... look, all i know is that i cannot wait a week until i see him. i mean, this is just too big. y'know, i just, i've just gotta talk to him. i... i gotta... ok, i'll see you later. |chandler| rachel, i love you! deal with me first! 
ross| |flight attendant| alright!
ross| ni-chou chi-ma! |rachel| ross! excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....

melanie| mmmmmm... oh, joey, joey, joey... i think i blacked out there for a minute!|joey| heh, heh. it was nothin'.
melanie| well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! |joey|  uhhh.. y'know what? forget about me. let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
melanie|  m-me again?|joey| sure! why not?
melanie| boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.|melanie| oooh, i gotta tell you... you are nothing like i thought you would be.
joey| how do you mean?|melanie| i don't know, i-i guess i just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' but you... you're a giver. you're like the most generous man i ever met. i mean... you're practically a woman.
monica| uh, so, uh, rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, i mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with ross or should i just throw it out?|rachel| i don't know. i don't know... i thought about it all the way there, and i thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's ross. y'know what i mean? i mean, it's ross.
monica and phoebe| sure.|rachel| i don't know, i mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but i'm thinking... oh, i'm thinking it'd be really great.
monica| oh my god, me too! oh! oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! y'know what the best part is? the best part is that you already know everything about him! i mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!|phoebe| yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
monica| another good point.|phoebe| no, i mean, i mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. y'know, it's... you're committed.
rachel|  huh?|phoebe| well, i mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
monica| why isn't it working out?|rachel| i don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
monica| is he not cute enough for you?|rachel| no!
monica| does he not make enough money?|rachel| no, i'm just....
phoebe| maybe there's someone else.|rachel| wha...
monica| is there? is there someone else?|rachel| no! there is.. there is noone else!
monica| then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?|chandler| hey, big...
joey| shhhh!|chandler|  ...spender.
joey| she's still asleep.|chandler| so how'd it go?
joey| oh, it was amazing. you know how you always think you're great in bed?|chandler| the fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
joey| well, it's like, last night, i couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. so i had to do all this other stuff. and the response i got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!|chandler| yes, i know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
joey| it was amazing! and not just for her... uh-uh. for me, too. it's like, all of a sudden, i'm blind. but all my other senses are heightened, y'know? it's like... i was able to appreciate it on another level.|chandler| i didn't know you had another level.
joey| i know! neither did i!|monica| hey, great skirt! birthday present?
rachel| yeah.|monica| oh, from who?
rachel| from you. i exchanged the blouse you got me.|monica| well, it's the thought. hey, doesn't ross's flight get in in a couple hours? at gate 27-b?
rachel| uh, yeah. uh, monica, y'know, honey, i've been thinking about it and i've decided thisthis whole ross thing, it's just not a good idea.|monica| oh, why?
rachel| because, i feel like i wouldn't just be going out with him. i would be going out with all of you. oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and i don't wanna...|monica|  no, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
rachel| monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...|monica| i am not 'so'! ok, i was a teensy bit weird at first, but... i'll be good. i promise.
rachel| who is it?|intercom| it's me, carl.
rachel| c'mon up.|monica| behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
joey| seven hundred bucks!|chandler| alright, you did it! do we have any fruit?
joey| man, hell of a two weeks, huh? y'know what, though? i really feel like i learned something.|chandler| really? so, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
joey| what, are you crazy? when a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? |carl| i'm just sayin', if i see one more picture of ed begley, jr. in that stupid electric car, i'm gonna shoot myself! i mean, don't get me wrong... i'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
ross| i can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.|rachel| would you excuse me, please? i'm trying to have a date here.
ross| fine, just stop thinking about me.|ross| can't do it, can you?
rachel| so i'm thinking about you. so what?|ross| i don't get it. what do you see in this guy, anyway?
rachel| well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....|carl| i mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
ross| rachel, come on. give us a chance.|rachel| ross, it's too hard.
ross| no, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? who cares about them. this is about us. look, i-i've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade. |rachel| ross, you're like my best friend.
ross| i know.|rachel| if we broke up, and i lost you...
ross| whoa, whoa, whoa. what makes you think we're gonna break up?|rachel| well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
ross|  no. but... it only has to happen once. look, you and i both know we are perfect for each other, right? i mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?|rachel| i don't know... i mean, i've never looked at you that way before.
ross| well, start looking. |rachel| wow.
carl| exactly! and you just know i'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!|rachel| right! you're right!
carl| heh... y'know?|rachel| you know what?
carl| what?|rachel| i forgot... i am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. i am so sorry! i'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do....  i meani'm sorry. i-i-i gotta go. i'm sorry. 
carl| but...|rachel|  excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. hi.
man| for god's sake, will you let it go? there's no rachel!|ross| oh, hey, hey, i got that.
julie| oh, thanks, sweetie.|ross| no problem. i cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
julie| really?|ross| yeah. 
julie| you don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?|ross| no, no, they will. i just... uh...
ross and julie| can't wait.|ross| come on, they're gonna love you.
phoebe| ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. ross was in love with rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and italian guys. finally chandler was like \forget about her\ but when ross was in china on his dig, chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel. she was like, \oh my god.\ so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that ross was getting off the plane with another woman. uh-oh! so, that's pretty much everything you need to know. but, enough about us. so, how've you been?|rachel| oh my god. oh my god.  
ross|  rach!|rachel| oh, there you are! hi! oh, so, so, how was china, you? 
ross| it was, it was great. oh, what happened?|rachel| what?
ross| you're bleeding. |rachel| i am? oh, look at that, yes i am. enough about me, enough about me, mr. back from the orient. come on. i wanna hear everything! everything. 
ross| well, where do i start? this is julie. julie, this is rachel.|rachel| these are, these aren't for you.  welcome to our country.
julie|  thank you. i'm from new york.|rachel| ok, well, not a problem. we'll just use them to stop the bleeding. ok. baggage claim? ok.
chandler| no way!|monica| i'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with ross! 
phoebe| oh my god. this is huge. this is bigger than huge. this is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?|joey| um, this?
phoebe| yes.|monica| guys, you got your hair cut.
chandler| yes, yes, we did, thanks to vidal buffay.|phoebe| 'cause, you know,  if you don't look good, we don't look good. i love that voice.
rachel|  airport, airport. ross, not alone, julie, arm around her. cramp, cramp.|chandler| ok, i think she's trying to tell us something. quick, get the verbs.
rachel|  you, you slowpokes!|ross| that's all right, rach, we got the bags. hi, hello. julie, this is my sister monica. this is chandler. phoebe. joey, what up?
joey| what up?!|ross| everyone, this is julie.
rachel|  julie.|all| ohh.  hi!
julie| hi, but i'm not here, you haven't met me. i'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when i don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.|ross| and bus.
julie| oh my god.|ross| the screaming guy?
julie| and the spitting?|ross| you gotta hear this story.
julie| we're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...|ross| 200 at least.
julie| ...and this guy...|rachel| and the chicken pooped in her lap. oh, i'm so sorry. i just gave away the ending, didn't i? oh! it's just, i just heard this story in the cab, and it is all i can think about.
monica| this is amazing. i mean, how, how did this happen?|julie| well, ross and i were in grad school together.
ross| but we haven't seen each other since then. well i land in china, guess who's in charge of the dig. |rachel| julie! julie, isn't that great? i mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
monica|  it's an expression.|ross| well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
julie| and then we've gotta get some sleep.|ross| yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
chandler| well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause i like to be surprised.|rachel| bye. 
ross| hey, rach, can i get some coffee?|rachel| yeah, sure.
ross| thank you.|chandler| hey, rach, can i get...
rachel| did you talk to him?|chandler| not yet.
rachel| then, no.|chandler| so what the hell happened to you in china? i mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
ross| i know, i know i was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. you know whose voice that was?|chandler| god?
ross| it was you, pal.|chandler| well, maybe it was god, doing me.
ross| look, you were right. she looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. but then i met julie, and i don't know, we're havin' a great time. and i have to say, i never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.|chandler| well, you owe me one, big guy.
rachel|  here's your lemonade.|ross| i didn't order lemonade.
rachel| oh. well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that. |ross| but...
rachel| go-go-go-go, come on!  so uh, what did you find out?|chandler| he said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. i'm sorry. but, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! without any outside help whatsoever.
rachel| how is that the silver lining?|chandler| you have to really wanna see it.
ross| ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.|monica| pheebes, you know what i'm thinking?
phoebe| oh, ok. how, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?|monica| no, although now that's what i'm thinking.
phoebe| all right, so what were you thinking?|monica| well, i was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, i thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
phoebe| ohh! no.|monica| why not?
phoebe| because, i'm just, i'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.|monica| no you're not.
phoebe| i know i'm not, but you are, and i was trying to spare your feelings.|joey| 
ross|  hello? hi.|chandler|  hi. anybody know a good tailor?
joey| needs some clothes altered?|chandler| no, no, i'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
joey| why don't you go see frankie? my family's been goin' to him forever. he did my first suit when i was 15. no wait, 16. no, 'scuse me, 15.  all right, when was 1990?|chandler| okay. you have to stop the q-tip when there's resistance!
ross|  well you didn't hang up either. |rachel| she didn't hang up either!
ross| ok, no, no, you hang up. you, you, y...|rachel|  sorry, i thought you were talking to me.
ross| rachel! i'll just call her back. |rachel| okay!
ross| |rachel|  ok, ok, ok. how did this happen to me? how did this happen to me? a week ago, two weeks ago, i was fine. ross was just ross, just this guy. now he's rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that i can't have.
monica| sweetie, i wanted you to have him too.|rachel| i know you did. i'm just gonna deal with it, i'm just gonna deal with it. 
chandler| ok, i don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.|joey|  you know, i think i was sixteen.
monica|  please, just a little bit off the back.|phoebe| i'm still on \no.\
rachel|  uh, morning. do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?|joey| no-no-no-no-no,  i'm not fallin' for that again.
phoebe| what's goin' on?|rachel| well, i sorta did a stupid thing last night.
chandler| what stupid thing did you do?|paulo|  bon giorno tutti!
phoebe| ewww! |rachel| ok, paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye. 
monica| rachel, how did this happen?|rachel| i don't know, i just kinda ran into him last night.
phoebe| where?|rachel| at his apartment. is this juice?
joey| whoa, whoa. and the fact that you dumped him because he hit on phoebe?|rachel| oh god, i know i'm a pathetic loser.
monica| honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.|chandler| people do stupid things when they're upset.
monica| my god, if i had a nickel for every guy i wish i hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.|all| hi!
ross| hi. sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching.|paulo|  hey, hey ross.
ross| hey, paulo. what are you doing here?|paulo| i do raquel.
ross|  so, uh, he's back.|rachel| yeah, he's back. is that a problem?
ross| no, not a problem.|rachel| good! i'm glad it's not a problem.
phoebe|  ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.|chandler| well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, i've got pants that need to be altered.
joey| hey, chandler, when you see frankie, tell him joey tribbiani says hello. he'll know what it means.|chandler| are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
monica|  you know it's funny, the last time paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.|phoebe| all right. ok, but, but! you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and monica about it.
monica| i promise.|phoebe| all right.  now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. but i promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
phoebe| all right, that's it, i quit.|monica| what? i didn't say anything.
phoebe| yeah, but this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.|monica| i'm sorry. i'm sorry, phoebe. it's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
phoebe| would you relax? i know what i am doing. this is how he wears it.|monica| how who wears it?
phoebe| demi moore.|monica| demi moore is not a he.
phoebe| well, he was a he in arthur, and in ten.|monica| that's dudley moore. i said i wanted it like demi moore.
phoebe| oh. oh!|monica| oh my god!
phoebe| oh my god!|monica| oh my god!
phoebe| oh my god! i'm sorry, i'm sorry. which one's demi moore?|monica| she's the actress that was in disclosure, indecent proposal, ghost!
phoebe| oh, she's got gorgeous hair.|monica| i know!
frankie| how long do you want the cuffs?|chandler| at least as long as i have the pants.
frankie| i just got that. ok, now we'll do your inseam.|rachel| how is she?
phoebe| it's too soon to tell. she's resting, which is a good sign.|ross| how's the hair?
phoebe| i'm not gonna lie to you, ross, it doesn't look good. i put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.|joey| can we see her?
phoebe| your hair looks too good, i think it would upset her. ross, why don't you come on in. |ross| yeah. 
joey| how're you doing?|rachel| i'm okay.
joey| ooh, that bad, huh? |rachel| what?
joey| look, i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. it's one of my gifts.|rachel| when i saw him get off that plane with her, i really thought i hit rock bottom. but today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
joey| you gotta tell ross how you feel.|rachel| come on. how can i just tell him? what about julie?
joey| what about her? they've only been going out for two weeks. ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.|rachel| i don't know, i don't know.
joey| look, rach, rach! i've been with my share of women. in fact, i've been with like a lot of people's share of women. the point is, i've never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you.|chandler|  your tailor is a very bad man!
joey| frankie? what're you talking about?|ross| 
chandler| joey's tailor...took advantage of me.|ross| what?
joey| no way. i've been going to the guy for 12 years.|chandler| oh come on! he said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
ross| what?|chandler| cupping.
joey| that's how they do pants! first they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.  what? ross, ross, would you tell him? isn't that how they measure pants?|ross| yes, yes it is. in prison! whatsa matter with you?
joey| what? that's not?  oh my god.|monica| even mary tyler moore would've been better.
ross| i like it. i do, i think it's a ten. |monica| thank you. my hair is very amused.
chandler| come on, monica, things could be worse. you could get caught between the moon and new york city. i know it's crazy, but it's true.|phoebe|  thank you.
ross| well, i gotta go. bye. bye, rach.|rachel|  wait, are you leaving?
ross| yeah, that's kinda what i meant by \bye!\|rachel| well, can i talk to you for a sec? 
ross| okay. |joey| hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
chandler| that's ok.|ross| what's goin' on?
rachel| well, first of all, paulo and i are not back together. it was just a stupid thing i did, and if i could go back in time and do it again, well, i wouldn't. um, second of all , what?|ross| ok. well, before i say anything, i just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then i tell you what i think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and i look like a complete idiot?
rachel| no. no-no-no-no.|ross| well, then, i think, i think the guy is scum. i hate him. i mean i actuallyi-i physically hate him. i always have. you are way too good to be with a guy like that. 
rachel| really?|ross| you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? someone who wakes up every morning thinking \oh my god, i'm with rachel\. you know, someone who makes you feel good, the way i am with julie.  was there a second of all?
rachel| no, i think that was the whole all.|ross| okay. okay.  okay.
joey| i swear to god, dad. that's not how they measure pants.|julie| i was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like andie mcdowell's new haircut?
phoebe| oh yeah! oh, i can do that.|julie| really?
phoebe| you wanna do it right now?|julie| great! 
phoebe|  ok, i just wanna be really sure this time. andie mcdowell's the girl from four weddings and a funeral, right?|rachel| no. no no no no no. that's rodney mcdowell. andie mcdowell is the guy from planet of the apes.
phoebe| oh, yeah. ok, thank you.|rachel| you're welcome.
monica| |phoebe| oh, look at these! hey, ben. just do it.  oh my god, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
susan| oh, is he hungry already?|carol| i guess so.

ross|  what are you guys doing?|chandler| we're just hanging out by the spoons. ladle?
ross| look, would you guys grow up? that is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.|joey| yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
ross| this is my son having lunch, ok? it's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. carol's fine with it, now come on.|ross| carol?
chandler| carol? i was just wondering if joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?|carol| sure.
joey| uh, does it hurt?|carol| it did at first, but not anymore.
joey| chandler?|chandler| so, uh, how often can you do it?
carol| as much as he needs.|joey| ok, i got one, i got one. uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
julie| rachel, do you have any muffins left?|rachel| yeah, i forget which ones.

rachel| mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?|monica| you know what probably happened? someone musta stolen my credit card.
rachel| and sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?|monica| that is an excellent excellent question. that is excellent.
rachel| monica, what is with you? who'd you have lunch with?|monica| judy.
rachel| who?|monica| julie.
rachel| what?!|monica| jody!
rachel| you were with julie?|monica| look, when it started i was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. and then, one thing led to another and, before i knew it, we were...shopping.
rachel| oh. oh my god. |monica| honey, wait. we only did it once. it didn't mean anything to me.
rachel| yeah, right. sure!|monica| really, rachel, i was thinking of you the whole time. look, i'm sorry, all right. i never meant for you to find out!
rachel| oh, please, you wanted to get caught. |monica| that is not true!
rachel| oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?|monica| did it ever occur to you that i might just be that stupid?
rachel| ok, monica. i just have to know one thing. did you go with her to bloomingdale's? |monica|  hi, steve.
carol and susan| hey! |carol| how did we do?
phoebe| oh, i tasted ben's milk, and ross freaked out.|ross| i did not freak out. 
carol| why'd you freak out?|ross| because it's breast milk. it's gross.
carol| my breast milk is gross?|susan| this should be fun.
ross| no, no, carol. there's nothing wrong with it. i just, i just don't think breast milk is for adults.|chandler| of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
carol| ross, you're being silly. i've tried it, it's no big deal. just taste it. |ross|  that would be no.
phoebe| come on. it doesn't taste bad.|joey| yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
susan| cantaloupe juice.|joey| exactly.
ross|  you've tasted it? you've tasted it.|susan| uh huh.
ross| oh, you've tasted it.|susan| you can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
ross|  |chandler| howdy.
joey|  gimme a box a juice. well, they switched me over to hombre.|chandler| well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
joey| or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  you should see this guy, chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.|chandler|  what do you care? you're an actor. this is your day job. this isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
joey| i know, but, i was the best, you know? i liked being the best.  i don't know. maybe i should just get outta the game. they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.|chandler|  all right, say you do that. you know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. and then where're you gonna run?
joey| yeah i guess you're right.|chandler| you're damn right i'm right. i say you show this guy what you're made of. i say you stand your ground. i say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
joey| i'm gonna do it. |chandler| all right. now go see miss kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
monica| i don't know what else to say.|rachel| well that works out good, because i'm not listening.
monica| i feel terrible, i really do.|rachel| oh, i'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
monica| rachel,  say that i'm friends with her, we spend some time together. is that so terrible?|rachel| yes.
monica| it's that terrible?|rachel| yes. monica, you don't get it. it's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that i am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
monica| me? what are you talking about? nobody could steal me from you. i mean, just because i'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. i mean,  you're my...we're, we're...oh, i love you.|rachel| i love you too. 
phoebe| you guys, um i know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um i love you guys too. |monica| look, i know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. i mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. i really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. would you just give that a chance, for me?
rachel|  i'd do anything for you, you know that.|monica| 
phoebe| wait, wait, wait, wait! |joey| mornin'.  i said, mornin'.
hombre man| i heard ya.|store guy| all right, everybody, i'm openin' the doors. you boys ready?
hombre man| ready.|joey| yeah, i'm ready.
customer| you idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, i'm suing!|store guy| oh my god, todd! what the hell did you do?
hombre man| i'm sorry. i am such a doofus. i'm so sorry, i'm so sorry.|annabelle|  my god, what happened?
joey| these new kids, they never last. sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. listen, uh, what do you say i buy you that cup of coffee now?|annabelle| sure.
julie| so.|rachel| so. i just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. i mean, you know, we've never really talked. i guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
julie| i know, i probably shouldn't even tell you this, but i'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.|rachel| really? me?
julie| yes. oh my god, are you kidding? ross is so crazy about you, and i really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but i kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.|rachel| well, you're not totally paranoid.
julie| oy.|rachel| um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which i'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, i just, i see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, monica's always saying how nice you are, and god i hate it when she's right.
julie| thanks. hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?|rachel| yeah, that'd be great. i'd love it.
julie| i'd love it too. shoot, i gotta go. so, i'll talk to you later.|rachel| all right, julie.
julie| bye. |rachel| bye.  what a manipulative bitch.
all| hey!|monica| so how was joan?
chandler| i broke up with her. |ross| dont tell me, because of the big nostril thing?
chandler| they were huge. when she sneezed, bats flew out of them.|rachel| come on, they were not that huge.
chandler| i'm tellin' you, she leaned back; i could see her brain.|monica| how many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
joey| hold it, hold it. i gotta side with chandler on this one. when i first moved to the city, i went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest adam's apple. it made me nuts.|chandler|  you or me?
ross| i got it. uh, joey, women don't have adam's apples.|joey| you guys are messing with me, right?
all| yeah.|joey| that was a good one. for a second there, i was like, \whoa.\
phoebe| you name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.|chandler| maureen rosilla.
ross| \cause she doesnt hate yanni,\ is not a real reason.|monica|  hello, mr. heckles.
mr. heckles| you're doing it again.|monica| we're not doing anything.
mr. heckles| you're stomping. it's disturbing my birds.|rachel| you don't have birds.
mr. heckles| i could have birds.|monica| okay, mr. heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
mr. heckles| thank you. i'm going to rejoin my dinner party.|rachel| all right, bye-bye.
chandler| okay, janice. janice. you gotta give me janice. that wasn't about being picky.|ross| we'll give you janice.
phoebe| i miss janice though.  \hello, chandler bing.\|rachel|  \oh, my, god.\
joey| |monica| stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
rachel| we won. we won!|monica| mr. heckles.
rachel| how did this happen?|mr. treeger| he musta been sweeping. they found a broom in his hand.
monica| that's terrible.|mr. treeger| i know. i was sweeping yesterday. it coulda been me.
ross| sure, you coulda. you never know.|mr. treeger| you never know.
phoebe| ok, it's very faint, but i can still sense him in the building.  go into the light, mr. heckles!|chandler| ok, phoebe.
phoebe| i'm sorry, but sometimes they need help.  that's fine. go ahead and scoff. you know there're a lot of things that i don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.|joey| such as?
phoebe| like crop circles, or the bermuda triangle, or evolution?|ross| whoa, whoa, whoa. what, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
phoebe| nah. not really.|ross| you don't believe in evolution?
phoebe| i don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, i just think it's a little too easy.|ross| too easy? too...the process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, is-is too easy?
phoebe| yeah, i just don't buy it.|ross| uh, excuse me. evolution is not for you to buy, phoebe. evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
phoebe| ok, don't get me started on gravity.|ross| you uh, you don't believe in gravity?
phoebe| well, it's not so much that you know, like i don't believe in it, you know, it's just...i don't know, lately i get the feeling that i'm not so much being pulled down as i am being pushed.|chandler| uh-oh. it's isaac newton, and he's pissed.
mr. treeger| there she is. and over there, that's the other one. this is mr. buddy boyle, mr. heckles' attorney. he'd like to talk to you.|monica| what can we do for you?
mr. boyle| all right, kids. here's the deal. according to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to \the noisy girls in the apartment above mine.\|monica| well, what about his family?
mr. boyle| he didn't have any.|rachel| ok, so let's talk money.
mr. boyle| all right, there was none. let's talk signing.  you be noisy girl number two.|monica| i can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. i mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?
monica| would you look at this dump? he hated us. this is his final revenge!|rachel| have you ever seen so much crap?
chandler| actually, i think this apartment sullies the good name of crap|joey| check this out. can i have this? 
ross| how can you not believe in evolution?|phoebe| just don't. look at this funky shirt!
ross| pheebs, i have studied evolution my entire adult life. ok, i can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? you can literally see them evolving through time.|phoebe| really? you can actually see it?
ross| you bet. in the u.s., china, africa, all over.|phoebe| see, i didn't know that.
ross| well, there you go.|phoebe| huh. so now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
chandler|  hey, look at this. \my big book of grievances.\|joey| hey, there's me! april 17th. excessive noise. italian guy comes homes with a date. hey chandler, look, you're in here too.
chandler| april 18th, excessive noise. italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. well that's excellent.|rachel| monica, monica, look at this lamp.  is this tacky or what? we have to have this.
monica| rache, i think we have enough regular lamps.|rachel| what? come on, it's not like i'm asking for this girlie clock or anything, which, by the way, i also think is very cool. 
monica| it doesn't go with any of my stuff.|rachel| well, what about my stuff?
monica| you don't have any stuff.|rachel| you still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
monica| no.|rachel| yes you do. you think of it as your apartment, and i'm just somebody who rents a room.
monica| mmmmm.|rachel| ok, while you \mmm\ on it for awhile, i'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
ross| ok, pheebs.  see how i'm making these little toys move? opposable thumbs. without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?|phoebe| maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
ross| please tell me you're joking.|phoebe| look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and i don't.
ross| no, no, pheebs, we can't, ok, because|phoebe| what is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? no, what's that all about? i think, i think maybe it's time you put ross under the microscope.
ross|  is there blood coming out of my ears?|joey| check it out, check it out. heckles' high school yearbook.
chandler| wow, he looks so normal.|phoebe| he's even kind of cute.
joey| \heckles, you crack me up in science class. you're the funniest kid in school.\|chandler| funniest? heckles? 
joey| that's what it says.|chandler| wow, heckles was voted class clown, and so was i.  he was right. would you listen to that?
phoebe| i'd call that excessive.|chandler| whoa! 
joey| what?|chandler| heckles played clarinet in band, and i played clarinet. and he was in the scale modelers club, and i was, well, there was no club, but i sure thought they were cool.
joey| so, you were both dorks. big deal.|chandler| i just think it's weird, you know? 
joey|  have you been here all night?|chandler| look at this. pictures of all the women that heckles went out with. look what he wrote on them.  vivian, too tall. madge, big gums. too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. this is, this is me. this is what i do. i'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
joey| chandler, heckles was a nut case.|chandler| our trains are on the same track, ok? yeah, sure, i'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. bitter town. aloneville. hermit junction.
joey| all right, you know what we gotta do? we gotta get you outta here. come on, i'll buy you breakfast, let's go.|chandler| what if i never find someone? or worse, what if i've found her, but i dumped her because she pronounced it supposably?
joey| chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.|chandler| how do you know that? how?
joey| i don't know, i'm just tryin' to help you out.|chandler| you'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and i'm gonna end up alone. will you promise me something? when you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
joey| well, i don't know. i don't know what we're gonna be doin'. i mean, what if we're at her folks' place?|chandler| yeah, i understand.
joey| you can come over and watch the super bowl. every year, all right?|chandler| you know what? i'm not gonna end up like this. i'll see you man.
joey| supposably. supposably. did they go to the zoo? supposably.|chandler|  hi, it's me.
janice| oh, my, god.|phoebe| janice? you called janice?
chandler| yes, janice. why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?|ross| you remember janice, right?
chandler| yes. she was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. janice is my last chance to have somebody.|janice|  helloo!!
chandler| ohmygod!|joey|  geez, look how fat she got.
janice| hey, it's everybody.|chandler| janice, you're
janice| yes, i am.|chandler| is it
janice| is it yours? ha! you wish, chandler bing. you are looking at a married lady now. |chandler| congratulations.
janice| oh, sweetie, i'm sorry.|chandler| you couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
janice| and what? missed the expression on your face? janice likes to have her fun.|monica| hey, rache. you know what we haven't played in a while?
rachel| what?|monica| hide the lamp.
rachel| monica, let it go.|monica| did you know i was allergic to shellfish?
rachel| well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.|phoebe| uh-oh. it's scary scientist man.
ross| ok, phoebe, this is it. in this briefcase i carry actual scientific facts. a briefcase of facts, if you will. some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.|phoebe| ok, look, before you even start, i'm not denying evolution, ok, i'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
ross| it's the only possibility, phoebe.|phoebe| ok, ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? 
ross| there might bea teenytinypossibility.|phoebe| i can't believe you caved.
ross| what?|phoebe| you just abandoned your whole belief system. i mean, before, i didn't agree with you, but at least i respected you. how, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? how, how are you going to face the other science guys? how, how are you going to face yourself?  oh! that was fun. so who's hungry?
rachel| i am. let me just get my coat.|rachel|  what happened?! what happened?!
monica| ok, all right. it was an accident, i swear, all right. i was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.|rachel| oh, please, monica. you've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
monica| phoebe, tell her!|phoebe| ok, i didn't see it, because i was putting on my jacket, but i uh want to believe you.
rachel| hey chandler. monica just broke my seashell lamp.|chandler| neat. i'm gonna die alone.
rachel| ok, you win.|monica| chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
chandler| janice was my safety net, ok? and now i have to get a snake.|phoebe| uh huh. why is that?
chandler| if i'm gonna be an old, lonely man, i'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. so i figure i'll be crazy man with a snake, yknow. crazy snake man. and i'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. \run away from crazy snake man,\ they'll shout!|monica| you have got to get over this. you're not gonna end up alone.
chandler| of course i am. i reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then i bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.|rachel| chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
monica| you are not a freak. you're a guy.|rachel| she's right. she's right. you are no different than the rest of them.
monica| wait a minute, wait a minute. yes he is. you are totally different.|chandler| in a bad way?
monica| no, honey, in a wonderful way. you know what you want now. most guys don't even have a clue. you are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.|rachel| yeah. you're not gonna end up alone.
phoebe| chandler, you called janice! that's how much you wanted to be with someone!|monica| you made it!
phoebe| you're there!|rachel| you are ready to make a commitment!
chandler| whoa! don't know about that.|rachel| what you got there? something else that's not yours that you can break?
monica| no. um, i know you like this, and i want you to have it. i think it'll look good in our apartment.|rachel| thank you.
monica| that's fine.|chandler| hey. well, you will all be pleased to know that i have a date tomorrow night. this woman alison, from work, she's great. she's pretty. she's smart. and uh, i've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. but, i'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. look at me. i'm growing.
joey| hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?|chandler| i'll take that.
joey| you want his yearbook?|chandler| yeah, yeah. some people said some nice things about him. i think somebody should have it.
monica| oh, gosh, this is so weird. i mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. you know, i think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for mr. heckles. i mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but he was a person. you're all going to hell.|rachel| it's really not that big!
chandler|  takin' that with you, huh?|joey| oh, yeah.
ross| you comin'?|chandler| yeah, just second.  we'll try to keep it down.
allison| oh, my major was totally useless. i mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see \philosopher wanted?\|chandler| sure.  my god, that's a big head! it didn't look this big in the office. maybe it's the lighting. my head must look like a golf ball at work. all right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about her: nice smile, good dresserbig head, big head, big head!
rachel| mom, would you relax. that was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, i would never do that. mom, c'mon, stop worrying. this is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing  it's open you guys.|stranger| hi.
rachel| hi, hi can i help you?|stranger| yeah, i'm looking for phoebe, does she still live here?
rachel| uh, no she doesn't but i can, i can get a message to her.|stranger| great. uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by. 
rachel| what? |stranger| hey, how, how did you do that?
joey| this is unbelievable phoebs, how can you be married?|phoebe| well, i mean, i'm not married, married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from canada and he just needed a green card.
monica| i can't believe you married duncan. i mean how could you not tell me? we lived together, we told each other everything.|phoebe| i'm sorry monica but i knew if i told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
monica| of course i wouldn't approve, i mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. i mean, what the hell were you thinking?|ross| you see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
phoebe| ok, i wasn't in love with him and i was just helping out a friend.|monica| please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and i saw you eat a cheeseburger.
all| huuh.|monica| well, didn't you?
phoebe| i might have.|monica| i can't believe you didn't tell me.
phoebe| oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.|monica| what have i not told you?
phoebe| oh, i don't know. umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with fun bobby out on the terrace.|rachel| what!
monica| wait a minute, who told you?  you are dead meat.|chandler| i didn't know it was a big secret.
monica| oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh i don't know, having a third nipple!|phoebe| you have a third nipple?
chandler|  you bitch.|ross| whip it out, whip it out.
phoebe| yeah! yeah! yeah!|chandler|  c'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
rachel| oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?|joey| i can't believe you. you told me it was a nubbin.
ross| joey, what did you think a nubbin was?|joey| i don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, i thought that's what it was. let me see it again.
all| yeah, show it. show it. the nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.|chandler| joey was in a porno movie.
all| huuh.|chandler| if i'm goin' down, i'm takin' everybody with me.
ross| you were in a porno?|joey| ahh, alright, alright, alright, i was young and i just wanted a job, ok. but at the last minute i couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
monica| that is wild.|ross|  so what's it shaped like?
phoebe| yeah, is there a hair on it?|joey| what happens if you flick it?
ross| so, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?|chandler| why yes ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of narnia.
julie| you know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. you get the best huts and women dance naked around you.|chandler| huh? are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
ross| you know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?|rachel|  ooh, julie's so smart, julie's so special.
monica| look honey, i wanted you to hook up with ross as much as you did. but he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.|rachel| ohh, i'm gonna have to get over it. god, see i didn't know that's i had to do, i just have to get over it.
all| woah.|joey| foxy lady.
julie| where you goin'?|phoebe| um, i'm gonna go meet duncan, he's skating tonight at the garden, he's in the capades.
joey| the ice capades?|chandler| no, no the gravel capades. yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when snoopy falls. . . funny.
monica| i can't believe you're dressing up for him. i mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.|phoebe| ok, no. for your information i'm going to see him so i can put all those feeling behind me. ok, and the reason i'm dressed like this is because i think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
ross|  hey chandler, would you fill me up here?|chandler| oh i see, i see, because of the third nipple thing. ha ha ha ha. . . 
ross| ok sweetie, i'll see you later.|julie| see you later rach.

ross| technically, huh, no.|rachel| wow. is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
ross| no, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. i mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .|rachel| no, no no no, don't need to know the details.
ross| it's just, it's, it's me. you, you know i've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. so now i've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and i. . . well, you just must think i'm weird.|rachel| no, no, no, no i don't think it's weird, i think, i think umm, in fact, in fact you know what i think?
ross| what?|rachel| i think it's sexy.
ross| sexy?|rachel| let me tell you something. as a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
ross| no kidding?|rachel| oh yeah. in fact you know what i'd do?
ross| what?|rachel| i'd wait.
ross| you'd wait?|rachel| yes, absolutely. i would wait and wait. . . then i'd wait some more.
ross| really?|rachel| oh yeah, i don't care how much she tells you she wants it, i don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. that just means it's working.
ross| women really want this?|rachel| more than jewelry. 
phoebe| hi.|duncan| phoebe!
phoebe| ta-da.|duncan| hey.

phoebe| i, i don't, i don't understand, how can you be straight? i mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great academy award parties.|duncan| i know, that's what i kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
phoebe| so how long have you known?|duncan| well i guess on some level i always knew i was straight. i though i was supposed to be something else, you know, i'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, i was just tryin' to fit in.
phoebe| and um, and there's actually a, a woman?|duncan| her name's debra.
phoebe| oh. well is she, is she the first that you've been with?|duncan| well, i've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when i'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. but i, i, i told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college. 
phoebe| sure.|duncan| but now i know i don't have a choice about this, i was born this way.
phoebe| i, i don't know what to say. i mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'oh, i'm not gay.'|duncan| i'm, i'm still me.
phoebe| why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?|monica| you know, it still smells like monkey in there.
julie| that saves us a conversation.|chandler| well, listen, this has been great but i'm officially wiped.
joey| me too, we should get goin'.|rachel| no, no, i mean, no, c'mon you guys, i mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
monica| rachel, that's all we do.|rachel| maybe that's all we do, what about julie?
julie| what about julie?|rachel| well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. i mean, who is julie? i mean, what do you like, what don't you like? we wanna hear everything.
julie| well, that could take a while.|rachel| so. i mean, who here does not have the time to get to know julie?
chandler| i got the time to get to know julie.|joey| i got time.
monica| rach, i know her pretty well, can i go?  that's fine.|rachel| ok julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
julie| well, in a nutshell. . .|rachel| nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
phoebe| so, um, have you told your parents?|duncan| no, but it'll be ok, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
phoebe|  here you go. you know what, i just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, i had been around, do you think that i would have been the one who. . . no, um, i'm sorry, don't tell me, i don't think either answer would make me feel better.|duncan| i love you phoebe. 
phoebe| so your brother's straigh huh? seriously.|julie| and my second grade teacher was ms. thomas, and my first grade teacher was mrs. cobb.
rachel| mrs., mrs. gobb?|julie| no cobb, as in cobb salad.
rachel| now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?|chandler| i'm goin' home.
rachel| what?|joey| boy that julie's a talker, huh?
ross| good-night.|rachel| so, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
ross| oh, no-no, i am.|rachel| oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
ross| um, no, i uh, i have done it before.|rachel| uh, ok, i mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. i mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
ross| i uh, i don't know, i guess i'm just gonna see, see what happens.|rachel| ok, gook luck.
ross| wha, uhh, what?|rachel| nothing, i mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
ross| ok, now i'm nervous.|rachel| maybe you should put it off.
ross| no, no, i don't wanna put it off, i just, god i just, i spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now i'm actually happy. you know, i mean, really happy. i just, i just don't wanna, i don't wanna mess it up, ya know.|rachel| i know, yeah, sorry.
ross| what, it's not your fault.|rachel| maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. i mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. i mean, women really like that.
ross| really?|rachel| yeah, i mean, you know it, i mean, if it were me i, i, you know, i'd want you to, i don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
ross|  uh-huh.|rachel| and then, i don't know, i mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that i'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. and, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
ross| ohh. . . thanks rach, goodnight. |rachel| ohh, god.
ross| good morning.|old woman| somebody got some last night.
chandler| spanish midgets. spanish midgets wrestling. julie. ok, yes, i see how you got there. |ross| you ever figure out what that thing's for?
chandler| no, see, i'm trying this new screening thing. you know, i figure if i'm always answering the phone, people'll think i don't have a life. my god, rodrigo never gets pinned. |machine|  here comes the beep, you know what to do.
chandler| what?|jade| i got a little drunk...and naked.

ross| i know.|chandler|  i'm back.
jade| so, are we gonna get together or what?|chandler| um, absolutely. uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? do you know uh, central perk in the village, say, five-ish?
jade| great, i'll see you then.|chandler| ok.  ok. having a phone has finally paid off.
ross| even though you do do a good bob impression, i'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, \hey, you're not bob.\|chandler| i'm hoping that when bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
ross| oh my god. you are pure evil.|chandler| ok, pure evil 
ross| yeah, yeah, everybody's here. hey, everybody, say hi to julie in new mexico.|all| hi, julie!

rachel| do you guys ever get the feeling that um, chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?|joey| yes! yeah, it's like they're always saying \let's go here, let's go there\. like we can afford to go here and there.
phoebe| yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, y'know, someplace nice, y'know? god, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for ross.|joey| for ross.

ross|  well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. hey, chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?|chandler| oh, see, i had to tell her that my number was your number, because i couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is bob's number.
ross| hey, tell me again, what do i do when mr. roper calls?|waiter| do i dare ask?
monica| yes, i will start with the carpaccio, and then i'll have the grilled prawns. |ross| that sounds great. same for me.
waiter| and for the gentleman?|joey| yeah, i'll have the thai chicken pizza. but, hey, look, if i get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?

chandler| we can talk about that.|phoebe| well, then...let's.
ross| well umm i, i just never think of money as an issue.|rachel| that's 'cause you have it.
ross| that's a good point.|chandler| so um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
joey| 'cause it's always somethin', you know, like with monica's new job, or the whole ross's birthday hoopla.|ross| whawhoa, hey, i don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negativethere's gonna be a hoopla?
rachel| basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.|monica| if it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
ross| g-gift? the thing's not the gift?|chandler| no, the thing was, we were gonna go see hootie and the blowfish.
ross| hootie and theoh my. i, i can catch them on the radio.|phoebe| no, now i feel bad. you wanna go to the concert.

ross| whoo!|phoebe| cool.
monica| yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank you.|ross| but wait, there's more. hey, chandler, what is in the envelope?

chandler| why, it's six tickets to hootie and the blowfish!  the blowfish!|monica| it's on us, all right, so don't worry. it's our treat.
phoebe| so...thank you.|ross| could you be less enthused?

joey| charity.|monica| charity?
ross| we're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.|rachel| ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big. 
phoebe| actually, it makes us feel that big. |ross| i don't, i don't understand. i mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
chandler| if you guys feel this big , maybe that's not our fault. maybe that's just how you feel.|joey| oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
rachel| ok, we never shoulda talked about this.|phoebe| i'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause i'm just not in a very hootie place right now.
rachel| me neither.|joey| me too.
monica| guys, we bought the tickets.|phoebe| oh, well, then you'll have extra seats y'know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
chandler|  why did you look at me when you said that?|monica| well, i guess now we can't go.
rachel| what? come on, you do what you want to do. do we always have to do everything together?|monica| you know what? you're right.
phoebe| fine.|ross| fine.

chandler| so, uh, how was he?|jade| eh.
chandler| eh?|jade| oh, bob, he was nothing compared to you. i had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
chandler| well, that makes me feel so good.|jade| it was just so awkward and bumpy.
ross|  bumpy?|chandler| well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. and uh maybe you have to get used to it.
jade| well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what i mean?|monica| you know what? i'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
ross| yeah, i know, it's my birthday. we all should be here.|chandler| so, let's go.
ross| well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.|chandler| yeah, i mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.

ross| cat. |phoebe|  hey joey.
joey| hey pheebs.|phoebe| how come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
joey| i can't find the remote.  thank you.|phoebe| so, scott asked me to come over for lunch today and i did.
joey| and?|phoebe| and we did.
joey| all right pheebs, way to go.|phoebe| yay me.
joey| so, so how did it happen?|phoebe| well, i finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
joey| and what did he say?|phoebe| he said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that i was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. so he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
joey| wow.|phoebe| yeah, so i said, \okay, relax please,\ y'know, i mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. so after a looooot of talking. . . i convinced him.
joey| let me get this straight. he got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.|phoebe| um-hum.
joey| this man is my god.|rachel| hi.
ross| i didn't get a cat.|rachel| oh, that's um, interesting.
ross| no, no it's not interesting. okay, it's very, very not interesting. in fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.|rachel| all right, i got it ross.
ross| you had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.|rachel|  what?
ross| i was doing great with julie before i found out about you.|rachel| hey, i was doin' great before i found out about you. you think it's easy for me to see you with julie?
ross| then you should have said something before i met her.|rachel| i didn't know then. and how come you never said anything to me.
ross| there was never a good time.|rachel| right, you, you only had a year. we only hung out every night.
ross| not, not, not every night. you know, and... and it's not like i didn't try, rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? like, like italian guys or ex-fiancs or, or, or italian guys.|rachel| hey, there was one italian guy, okay, and do you even have a point?
ross| the point is i... i don't need this right now, okay. it, it's too late, i'm with somebody else, i'm happy. this ship has sailed.|rachel| yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
ross| hey, i've been doin' it since the ninth grade, i've gotten pretty damn good at it.|rachel| all right, fine, you go ahead and you do that, all right ross.
ross| fine.|rachel| 'cause i don't need your stupid ship.
ross| good.|rachel| good.  
rachel| and ya know what, now i've got closure.|ross| try the bottom one.

chandler| nothing, except tell you, uh, i think it's wonderful how much energy you have.|monica| well, thanks.
chandler| i mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.|monica| well, you know.
chandler| you know, i mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.|monica|  uh-huh.
chandler| and it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.|monica| well no, but um.
chandler| i mean, if it were me, i think i'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.|monica| y'know, i try to stay positive. . .
chandler| so, you feel like goin' for a run?|monica| all right.

ross| yeah, it was, but...i get home, ok, and i see julie's saline solution on my night table. and i'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am i doing? i mean, here i am, i am with julie, this incredible, great woman, who i care about and who cares about me, and i'm like, what, am i just gonna throw all that away?|joey| you got all that from saline solution?
mnca| we are talking about rachel here. you and rachel.|ross| believe me, i've been dreaming about me and rachel for ten years now. but now, i'm with julie, so it's like me and julie, me and rachel, me and julie, me and... ... rachel. rachel, rachel.
rach|  hey, you.|ross| how are you?
rach| good. how are you?|ross| good.
julie| hi, honey.|ross| hi, julie.  hi, julie. julie, um, how are you?
julie| good.|ross|  good, so everybody's here. everybody's good. so, were you gonna play something, phoebe?
phoe| oh, well, actually.|ross|  play it.
phoe| ok, all right.|joey| hey, julie, i didn't know you wore lenses.
julie| what?|ross|  ssshh.
phoe| ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that i made up. um, it's called, um, \two of them kissed last night\. |phoe|  there was a girl, we'll call her betty, and a guy let's call him neil. now i can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. now our neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. will betty be the one who he loves truly? or will it be the one who we'll call ju...loolie? he must decide, he must decide, even though i made him up, he must decide!
rtst| this is a nice resume. nice, nice, nice. muy impressivo.|mnca| so, mr. rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? the ad wasn't too clear.
rtst| mockolate.|mnca| i'm sorry?
rtst| mockolate. it's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.|mnca| ohh.
rtst| go ahead. try a piece. yeah, we think that mockolate is even better than chocolate.|mnca| all right. mmm-mmm.
rtst| yeah?|mnca|  i love how it crumbles. now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
rtst| no, ma'am. well, anyhoo, we should be getting our f.d.a. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for thanksgiving. see, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: easter, christmas, what have you.|mnca|  mmm-mmm.
rtst| but, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make thanksgiving the mockolate holiday.|mnca| wow.
rtst| aren't you going to swallow that?|mnca| just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
rtst| yeah, isn't that great?|mnca|  mmm.
rtst| well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some thanksgiving-themed recipes. you think you might be interested?|mnca| abso......lutely. see, i love creating new recipes. i love thanksgiving. and, well, now, i love mockolate.
rtst| really?|mnca| especially the after taste, you know, i'll tell ya, that'll last ya till christmas.
mnca| how about mockolate mousse?|phoe| it's not, it's not very thanksgiving-y.
mnca| ok, how about pilgrim mockolate mousse?|phoe| what makes it pilgrim?
mnca| we'll put buckles on it.|rach| hey.
phoe| hey.|mnca| hey.
rach| did uh, ross call?|mnca| no, i'm sorry.
rach| why didn't he call? he's gonna stay with julie, isn't he? he's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, \hi, i'm julie, ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together.\|phoe| no offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
ross| i don't know what to do. what am i gonna do? i mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.|chan| oh, i know. this must be so hard. oh, no. two women love me. they're both gorgeous and sexy. my wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
joey| hey, here's a thought, ross. |chan| don't touch the computer. don't ever touch the computer.
joey| ross, listen. i got two words for you. threesome.|chan| ok, all right, look. let's get logical about this, ok? we'll make a list. rachel and julie, pros and cons. oh. we'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and i can use different colors for each column.
ross| can't we just use a pen?|chan| no, amish boy.
joey| ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. all right, rachel first.|ross| i don't know. i mean, all right, i guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
joey| you could say that.|ross| and i guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. and i've seen her be a little too into her looks. oh, and julie and i, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but rachel's just a waitress.
chan| waitress. got it. you guys wanna play doom? or we could keep doing this. what else?|ross| i don't know.
joey| oh, her ankles are a little chubby.|chan| ok, let's do julie. what's wrong with her?
ross|  she's not rachel.|mnca| ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. this is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. just like the indians served.
rach| oh my god.|mnca| oh my god good?
rach| oh my god, i can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.|phoe| oh, oh sweet lord! this is what evil must taste like!
chan| i'm telling you this thing won't print. yes, i pressed that button like 100 times. you know, for a hot line you are not so hot. what? what is that in the background? are you watching star trek?|joey|  hey, so how'd it go with julie? did you, did you break her heart?
ross| yes, it was horrible. she cried. i cried. she threw things, they hit me. anyway, i did the right thing.|chan|  so, spock actually hugs his father?
rach| hey, do you guys have......hi.|ross| hi.
rach|  where you goin'?|ross| i uh, i just got back from uh, from julie's.
rach|  oh.|ross| no, no, uh, it's not what you think. it's um the other thing.
rach| well, what's the other thing, what do i think?|ross| well, uh.
joey| he broke up with julie. well, go hug her, for god's sakes.|rach| really?
ross| really. it's always been you, rach.|rach| oh, god.
rach| oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.|ross| i know, i know, it's, it's almost... what do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
rach| let me get my coat.|ross| ok. no, hey, whoa, whoa, i'll get your coat.
rach| ok, he's goin' to get my coat. he's goin' to get my coat. oh my god, you guys. i can't believe this. this is unbelievable.  what's that?|chan|  what? nothing.
rach| what's that? what? i saw my name. what is it?|chan| no, no, see? see?  hey, it's printing!
rach| well what is it? let me see.|ross| hey, someone order a coat?
rach| ross, chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.|ross| he won't?  he won't! because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
chan| yes, yes it is, short story, that i was writing.|rach| and i'm in it? then let me read it.
rach| come on.|joey| hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
chan|  \it was summer, and it was hot. rachel was there. a lonely gray couch. 'oh, look,' cried ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. the end.\|ross| that's it? that's all you wrote? you're the worst writer in the whole world.
rach| all right, you know what? this isn't funny anymore. there's something about me on that piece of paper and i want to see it.|ross| no, you don't.
rach| all right, you know what, that's fine. if you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. i do not need to see it. |rach| what is this? ross, what is this?
chan| good luck.|ross| ok, just, just remember how crazy i am about you, ok?
rach| kind of ditzy? too into her looks? spoiled?|ross| now that's a little spoiled. he was supposed to type \little\, the idiot.
rach| just a waitress?|ross| no, that, that was, i mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. is this over yet rach?
rach| oh! i do not have chubby ankles!|ross| no, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. look at julie's column.
rach| she is not rachem. what the hell's a rachem? is that some stupid paleontology word that i wouldn't know because i'm just a waitress.|ross| no, rach, come on. rach! rach, no, no! she's not rachel, she is, she is not, ra--rachel?
chan| my diary! my diary, that's brilliant. i should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.|mnca| you know, that's true. you'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
phoe| i... i cannot believe ross even made this list. what a dinkus.|joey| hey, cut him some slack. it was chandler's idea.
phoe| what?|mnca| what?
chan| oh good, i was hoping that would come up.|mnca| this was your idea?
phoe| what were you thinking?|chan|  all right, let's get some perspective here, ok? these things, they happen for a reason.
mnca| yeah. you!|chan| all right, pheebs, back me up here, ok? you believe in that karma crap, don't you?
phoe| yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.|ross| rach! whoops! rach, hey, open up, please!
rach|  when somebody does not buzz you in, ross, that means go away. that doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.|ross| i just wanna read something. it's your pro list.
rach| not interested.|ross|  ok, ok, number one: the way you cry at game shows. number two: how much you love your friends. number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. number five: how great you are with ben. 
ross| number six: the way you smell.|joey|  hey, ross! what are you doin'?
ross| hey, joey. you wanna open the window?|joey| oh, yeah, i do.
chan| what are you doing out there?|ross| i am, uh, i am...
mnca| oh, you must be freezing. you know what you need? how about a nice steaming cup of hot mockolate?|ross| rach, come on, open up. rach, come on, come on, rach. you got to give me another chance.
rach| no.|ross| no?
rach| that's what i said.|chan| look, maybe we should go?
rach| no, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.|ross| rach, come on, look, i know how you must feel.
rach|  no, you don't, ross. imagine the worst things you think about yourself. now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.|ross| no, but, but i wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
rach| oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, ross.  i said don't go!|ross| you know what? you know what? if, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
rach| well, then, i guess that's the difference between us. see, i'd never make a list.|joey|  maybe a little longer.
mnca| now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. i've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.|rtst| doesn't matter.
mnca| what?|rtst| our fda approval didn't come through. something about laboratory rats.
mnca| oh, gosh, i'm sorry.|rtst| yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check.  thank you for all the trouble you went through. um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
mnca| well, uh, i ate some.|rtst| oh, some, that's fine. some is fine. some is not a lot. so, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?
mnca| hello?|ross| hi.
rach|  is that him again? tell him i'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.|mnca|  listen, i... i don't think this is the best time.
ross| look, can, can you do something for me?|mnca| sure, what? ok, ok.  music?
radio| the next one's dedicated to rachel from ross. rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.  |radio| uh, we've just gotten a call from rachel, and she told us what ross did. it's pretty appalling, and ross, if you're listening, i don't wanna play your song anymore. why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? avery, michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
rtst| hi, thanks for coming in again.|mnca| oh, not at all. i have no morals and i need the cash.
rtst| it's like i'm lookin' in a mirror. anyway, they're called \fishtachios\. they taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. here, try one. you're not allergic to anything, are you?|mnca| cat hair.
joey| i'm excited! i've never gotten reviewed before.|mnca| you were so amazing as the king. i was really impressed, i was.
phoe| although, you know what? you might want to consider wearing underwear next time. yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.|joey| here it is, here it is.  the only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was joseph tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.
chan| ok, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. phoebs, read yours.|phoe| ok.  the only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...
chan| does anyone have one from a different paper? ross, read yours.|ross| i don't want to.
rach| joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.|ross| yeah.
joey| maybe they do. i've been doin' this ten years and i haven't gotten anywhere. there's gotta be a reason.|ross| oh c'mon. maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.
joey| no, no, no, it.. it's too hard. it's not worth it. i quit.|mnca| wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. wait a minute. i believe this will change your mind.  sucking.
joey| when i was little, i wanted to be a veteranarian, but then i found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.|ross|  hiiiiii.
phoe| are... are you ok?|ross| yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. a stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. whoa, whoa, i know this jacket, this is, th--fun bobby's jacket! where is he, what. he, he's here, isn't he?
mnca| maybe.|ross| don't toy with me.
fbob| geller!|ross| hey, fun bobby!
fbob| hey. whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?|ross| not at all! i love this guy. hey, i was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
mnca| you and me both.|fbob| hey, so what'd i miss, what'd i miss, c'mon?
phoe| oh, we were just trying to make joey feel better.|fbob| hey, do you need me to pick you up?
joey| no, i'm alright man. really.|fbob| no, i'm picking you up.
joey| hey no, seriously, i don't need you to pick me...  alright! it still works.|fbob| ok, now before i go, does anybody else need to be picked up?  i'm still gonna go.
mnca| ok, i'll see you later babe.|fbob| uh, public display of affection coming up. you can avert your eyes. 
fbob| see ya. |all| bye! see you later!
phoe| fun bobby is so great.|mnca| oh, isn't he? oh, you know, i really think this time it may work with him. i mean, he just makes me feel so good and i've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. well, at least my cup is half full.
phoe| half full of looooovvvvve.|mnca| and for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
phoe| cabin of loooooovvvvve.|rach| we went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys. 
mnca| really? i only had two glasses.|joey| i just had a glass.
phoe| two.|rach| i had one glass.
chan| i had about a mugful in this lovely 'i got boned at the museum of natural history' mug.|rach| ok, so that's... that's what, two bottles? and yet somehow we went through five?
ross| oooooh.|joey|  ooooooh.
mnca| so what. so he drank a lot tonight.|ross| yeah but, you know, now that i think about it, i don't think i've ever seen fun bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
phoe| yeah. oh, oooh, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, ok, 'i was soooo wasted,' or, 'oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'so i wake up, and i'm in this dumpster in connecticut.'|joey| monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
mnca| well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. i mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.|mnca| rach, does this have nonfat milk?
rach| ehhhummmm, i don't know, why don't you taste it.|mnca|  mmmm, no.
rach| oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.|fbob|  whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees irish?
phoe| um, cake.|rach| yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake. 
mnca| you know what? it seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff irish lately.|fbob| well, i would make them belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
mnca| bobby.|fbob| yeah, ok.
mnca| look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, i don't know... but, uh, i'm kind of worried about you.|fbob| ok, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, i don't know... i always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'i'm just a social drinker,' or, 'c'mon, it's flag day.'
mnca| so, what are you saying now?|fbob| i guess i'm saying, i'll try and quit. i kinda like that you worry about me. 
phoe|  sooo, what's goin' on, huh?|fbob| i am gonna try and quit drinking.
phoe|  ooohh, why?|chan| hey.
joey| hey.|mnca| hey.
phoe| hey.|chan| guess who's back in show business.
phoe| ohh, ohh, lorne green?|chan| no, no, phoebs. you know why? cause he's dead.
phoe| oh, no.|chan| ok, i guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... joey, that's who.
joey| yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for days of our lives!|phoe| oh, well, we have to celebrate. you know what we should do? we should do, like, a soap opera theme.
chan| hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|phoe| hey rach, what time do you get off? we're all gonna do something tonight.
rach| ummmm.... well, actually i'm already done, but i...i kinda got plans.|mnca|  you have other friends?
rach| yeah... i, uhh... i have a... i have a date.|mnca| what?
joey| with a man?|rach| what? what is so strange about me having a date?
joey| what about ross? i mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?|rach| noooo, no, i'm not mad at him. i'm.. i'm not really anything at him anymore.
mnca| what are you talking about?|rach| i don't know. whatever i was feeling, i'm... not.
phoe| but you guys came so close.|rach| oh, i know, i'm sorry you guys. you're just gonna have to get used to the fact that i will not be dating ross.
rach| here he is. hi. guys, this is russ.|russ|  hhhhiiiii.
estl| stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. it's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. oh, honey, give me a break, will ya?  oooh, ooh, i'll talk to you later.|estl| well, there's my favorite client. so tell me darling, how was the audition?
joey| well, i think it went pretty well. i.. i got a callback for thursday.|estl| joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
joey| no.|estl| well, here it is. 
joey| ok, uh.... listen, there's something i want to talk to you about. the network casting lady...|estl| oh, isn't lori a doll?
joey| oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... i kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. and i definitely would get the part if i would've... you know... if i would have sent the little general in.|estl| oh, i see. well, i'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out.  yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
rach| what's the matter?|mnca| it's fun bobby.
rach| what, isn't he sober?|mnca| oh, he's sober alright. just turns out that fun bobby was fun for a reason.
rach| ohhh, ok.|mnca| alright, here you go, sweetie. 
fbob| thanks. you wanna hear something funny?|mnca| oh god, yes!
fbob| there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the village.|phoe| that is funny.
fbob| i needed to buy a hammer the other night, and i'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the village.|mnca| ahhh, hey honey? don't you have to be at your interview now?
fbob| oh yeah. see you guys. |chan| bye..... ridiculously dull bobby.
mnca| oh.... my... god.|phoe| it's not that bad.
mnca| not that bad? did you hear the hammer story?|phoe| ok, ok, don't get all squinky.
rach| maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.|mnca| but i'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. i mean, i can't break up with him. i'm the one who made him quit drinking. he's dull because of me.
phoe| alright, don't say that. he's probably always been dull. you just, you know, set it free.|russ| hi.
chan|  hey ross.... bahhhh!|rach| hi russ, i've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, ok?
russ| ok, i'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people.|phoe| rachel? um, hi.
rach| hi.|phoe| ok, so, you know what you're doing, right?
rach| uhh.... waitressing?|phoe| well, yeah, but... no. i mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't russ just remind you of someone?
rach|  huh, bob saget?|phoe|  oh, yeah! no, no, no, no, oh, oh.
phoe| oh, my, oh!|ross| what? what's wrong?
phoe| i, ok....|mnca| she's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
ross| alright.|chan|  ross, russ. russ, ross.
russ| hi.|ross| hi.
russ| are you a, uh, friend of rachel's?|ross| yes, yes i am. are you a, uh, a friend of rachel's?
russ| actually, i'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of rachel's.|ross| a date.
russ| yeah, i'm her date.|ross| oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
chan| you know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose ross, we have a spare.|russ| oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
ross| yes, yes i am. and you are a....|russ| periodontist.
mnca| see? they're as different as night and... later that night.|ross| well, i am going to, uh... get a beverage. it was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
russ| ditto.|ross| i, uh, well... i... i met russ.
rach| oh.|ross| hey, i didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
rach| well, we're not seeing each other, so....|ross| well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. but so far i've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
rach| well, yeah, this is the deal.|ross| ok, well, um, have a nice evening.
rach| um, russ, you ready?|russ| yeah.
rach| bye.|mnca| bye.
phoe| bye.|ross|  she's dating. she's dating.
chan| yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?|ross| what do you mean?
mnca| do you not see it?|ross| see what? i don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. and it takes him, what? like... like... i don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
chan| yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?|ross| ....................yeah.
chan| hey.|joey| hey.
chan| whoa, whoa, so i'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, italy called and said it was hungry.|joey| well, the part's mine if i want it.
chan| oh my god!|joey| yeah, if i'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
chan|  oh my... god?|joey| ten years i've been waiting for a break like this chandler, ten years! i mean, days of our lives. that's actually on television.
chan| so, what're you gonna do?|joey| well, i guess i could sleep with her... i mean, how could i do that?
chan| well, i... i've got a pop-up book that told me everything i need to know.|joey| i've never slept with someone for a part.
chan| well is she... |joey| sorry.
chan| it's alright. is she good-looking?|joey| yeah, she's totally good looking. i mean, if i met her in a bar, or something, i'd be buying her breakfast.  you know, after having slept with her.
chan| y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. y'know, i mean, the way that i see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. y'know, i mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got christmas.|joey| i just... i just don't think that i want it that way though, y'know? i mean, let's say i do make it, alright? i'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the little general.
chan| didn't you used to call it the little major?|joey| yeah, but after denise demarco, i had to promote it.
waiter| can i get you something from the bar?|mnca| yes, i would like something.  no, no thank you.
fbob| if... if you want to drink, it's ok with me, i've got to get used to it.|mnca| no, no really. i.. i wouldn't feel right about it.  just some water.
fbob| so the light went out in my refrigerator...|mnca|  i'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
chan| hey, we're having some fun now, huh, ross? wanna do another one, huh russ? ok... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.|russ| dysprosium.
ross|  dysprosium? try mendelevium.|chan| and weenie number two has it. unless, of course, nine-down, knights in white satin was sung by the doody blues.
phoe| you don't see it? you actually don't see it?|rach| what?
phoe| ok honey, you're dating ross.|rach| no, phoebs. i'm dating russ.
phoe| russ is ross. russ... ross!|rach| steve... sleeve!
phoe| ok, noone is named sleeve.|rach| phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? other than their names being similar, i'm sorry, i do not see what you're seeing.
ross|  for your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.|russ| you could not be more wrong. you could try... but you would not be successful.

ross| oh you do, do you?|russ| um-hum, you're jealous.
ross| of... of what?|russ| you're jealous because i'm a real doctor.
ross| hey, you're a doctor of gums. that's the smallest body part you can major in. it's like day one, floss. day two, here's your diploma.|russ| hey, you listen.
ross| no, no, let me finish.|russ| no, let me finish.
ross| no, you let me fini...|ross| hi.

ross| ooooohhhh.|phoe| what's with all the bottles of liquor?
ross| what's going on, is... uh, bobby drinking again?|mnca| oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. that way he's still sober but i find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
rach| oh god, even his knock is boring.|mnca| hi. i'll be ready in just a second.
fbob| uh, can i talk to you a minute?|mnca| sure.
fbob| this is really hard for me to say.|mnca| oh god, you fell off the wagon.
fbob| oh, no, no, it's about you.|mnca| what about me?
fbob| i think you may have a drinking problem.|mnca| what these?  oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
fbob| look, i am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, ok?|mnca| oh... shoot.
fbob| well, anyway, i hope we can be friends.|mnca| ok.
mnca| take care.|fbob| you too.
rach| what happened?|mnca| well we... we kinda broke up.
gang| awwwwwwww.|mnca|  does anybody want these?
chan| i'll take one. sometimes i like to hold stuff like this and pretend i'm a giant.|joey| hey.
gang| hey!|ross| how'd the callback go?
joey| it was unbelievable! i walked in there and she was all over me.|chan| so what'd you do?
joey| well, i couldn't do it. i told her i didn't want to get the part that way.|ross| good for you.
joey| but wait, wait, wait. then, after i left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.|phoe| so... and?
joey| soooooo... you are now looking at dr. drake ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!|gang| allright!
joey| alright... i've got to go shower. |russ| hi.
chan| oh, hey.|phoe| hi.
russ| i guess you guys heard, rachel dumped me.|chan| yeah, i'm sorry man.
russ| oh, all she said was that i remind her too much of somebody. you have any idea who she's talking about?|phoe| oh i do, it's.... it's bob saget. she hates him.
russ| oh.|julie| hey.
chan| hey!|phoe| hey, julie! hey, how are you doing?
carol| so how did everything go?|ross| oh, great. great. there was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
carol| well, we've gotta go.|ross| ok.
susan| |carol| oh, right. um, i've got some news. it's about us.
ross| oh, you and me?|carol| uh, no, susan and me.
susan| the other us.|ross| ok.
carol| we're uh, we're getting married.|ross| as in, \i now pronounce you wife and wife\ married?
carol| anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.|ross| why wouldn't i want to come? i had fun at the first wedding.
carol| look i just thought that...|ross| no no no, i mean, hey, why shouldn't i be happy for you? what would it say about me if i couldn't revel in your joy? i'm revelling baby, believe me!
susan| is your finger caught in that chair?|ross| mmm hmmm.
carol| want us to go?|ross| uh-huh.
ross| this is so cool. you're actually gonna be on television.|joey| it really hit me last night. i'm gonna be on days of our lives. and then i started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
monica| yes! carol and susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.|monica| they want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as i've never catered before, and i really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
ross| would it matter?|monica| oh, you are so great!  thank you!
joey| are you really not going?|ross| i am really not going. i don't get it. they already live together, why do they need to get married?
monica| they love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.|ross| if you wanna call that a reason.
chandler|  who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? hi, neighbor.|monica| ross, i thought you were over this.
ross| look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? she's my ex-wife. if she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|joey| hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
rachel|  did i miss it? did i miss it?|joey| no, i'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
chandler| whoa, she's pretty.|joey| yeah, and she's really nice too. she taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
rachel| i'm sorry, what?|monica| what?
joey| it's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. so while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. |chandler| oh, ok.
joey| there's my scene, there's my scene.  \mrs. wallace, i'm dr. drake ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. |mrs. wallace| is she gonna be all right?
joey| i'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.|chandler| nice!
rachel| that's great!|ross| excellent!
chandler| for a minute there i thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.|ross| that is so good! do it again!
joey| all right, all right. \damnit braverman, it's right there on the chart!\|chandler| that's great. all right, i gotta get to work, i got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
ross| no no, that's me.|chandler| oh, yeah. 
ross| oh, hello.|phoebe| oh, thanks. i couldn't uh...
ross| is everything ok?|phoebe| um, no, huh-uh. one of my clients died on the massage table today.
ross| oh my god.|chandler| that's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
phoebe| yeah, um, she was 82 years old. her name was um, mrs. adelman.|monica| oh, honey.
phoebe| yeah, it's just so strange. i mean, she probably woke up today and thought, \ok, i'll have some breakfast, and then i'll take a little walk, and then i'll have my massage.\ little did she know god was thinking, \ok, but that's it.\ oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, i was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, i don't think it went very far.|rachel| what do you mean?
phoebe| i think it went into me.|monica| god, this is so hard. i can't decide between lamb or duck.
chandler| well, of course, lambs are scarier. otherwise the movie would've been called silence of the ducks.|rachel| ok, who ordered what?
ross| oh, i believe i had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.|chandler| yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
rachel| oh god.|joey| i can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
rachel| i know, but it's just it's the first time, and i just don't want her to think that because i didn't marry barry, that my life is total crap, you know?|phoebe|  talk about crap. try listening to stella niedman tell the story of her and rod steiger for the hundredth time.
joey| uh, pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?|phoebe| i don't know. i mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business.  sit up!
mrs. green|  there she is.|rachel| mom!
mrs green| sweetie! so this is where you work? oh, it's wonderful! is it a living room? is it a restaurant? who can tell? but i guess that's the fun.|rachel| pretty much.
mrs green| monica! you look gorgeous! last time i saw you, it was eat or be eaten.|rachel| this is joey, and phoebe, and this is chandler, and you remember ross.
mrs green| oh hello, ross. |ross| hi, mrs. green. 
mrs green| so, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?|rachel| oh mom!
mrs green| if you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.|chandler| believe me, sometimes that happens.
mrs green| this is just so exciting. you know, i never worked. i went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. i am just so proud of you.|rachel| really?
mrs green| yes.|phoebe| i know who it is you remind me of. evelyn dermer. 'course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. now she looks like soupy sales.
joey| pheebs, who's evelyn dermer?|phoebe| i don't know. who's soupy sales?
mrs green| oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.|rachel| yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
mrs green|  you have some life here, sweetie.|rachel| i know. and mom, i realize you and daddy were upset when i didn't marry barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
mrs green| i do. you didn't love barry. and i've never seen you this happy. i look at you and i think, oh, this is what i want.|rachel| for...me.
mrs green| well, not just for you.|rachel| well, what do you mean?
mrs green| i'm uh, considering leaving your father.|monica|  all right. tell me if this is too cute. lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
rachel| oh god. i think i'm gonna be sick.|monica| why? it's not like i'm putting little nipples on them.
ross| and you had no idea they weren't getting along?|rachel| none.
joey| they didn't fight a lot?|rachel| no! they didn't even talk to each other. god, how was i supposed to know they were having problems?
phoebe|  in my day, divorce was not an option.|joey| hey, look who's up.
rachel| i just can't believe this is happening. i mean, when i was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. i just figured as a grownup i wouldn't have to worry about this.|monica| is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? i mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
rachel| well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?|chandler| you know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. but in your case it's actually kinda true.
phoebe| that's him.|chandler| damn. my mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
mr a| phoebe?|phoebe| yes, hi, mr. adelman. thanks for meeting me.
mr a| oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.|phoebe| um, do you wanna sit?
mr a| oh, no, please, i spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. now uh, what can i do for you, my dear?|phoebe| i don't know how to say this, but i think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
mr a| you're saying, my wife is in you?|phoebe| yeah. ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
mr a| well, i don't know what to tell you dear. the only thing i can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.|phoebe| everything?
mr a| everything.|phoebe| whoa, that's a lot of stuff.
mr a| oh, wait, i remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.|phoebe| i'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
mr a|  worth a shot, huh?|mrs green| look at this.
rachel| these are from halloween three years ago.|mrs green| oh, look, here's barry. did he have to come straight from the office?
rachel| no, that was his costume. see, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.|monica| um, you guys, you know when i said before, \thank you, but i don't really need your help\?
rachel| actually, what i think you said was, \don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.\|monica| really? weird. anyway, see, i planned everything really well. i planned and i planned and i planned. it just turns out, i don't think i planned enough time to actually do it.
rachel| hey, mon, you want some help?|monica| if you want.
phoebe|  hey. what a day. i took her everywhere. the museum of modern art, rockefeller center, statue of liberty.|rachel| she's still with you?
phoebe| yeah. i guess she hasn't seen everything yet. i'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again.  oh, such a pretty face.|mrs green| this is so much fun, just the girls. you know what we should do? does anybody have any marijuana?
rachel| god!|monica| all right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. 
mrs green| that's fine. i never did it. i just thought i might. so, what's new in sex?|rachel| oh! what's new in sex?
mrs green| the only man i've ever been with is your father.|monica| i'm dicing, i'm dicing, i don't hear anything.
mrs green| i mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but i was thinking there might be more.|rachel| oh, i'm sorry. you know what? i cannot have this conversation with you. i mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell daddy. what? what do you want? do you want my blessing?
mrs green| no.|rachel| you want me to talk you out of it?
mrs green| no.|rachel| then what? what do you want?
mrs green| i guess i just figured of all people you would understand this.|rachel| why on earth would i understand this?
mrs green| you didn't marry your barry. i did.|rachel| oh.
monica| all right people, we're in trouble here. we've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. move, move, move!|chandler| monica, i feel like you should have german subtitles.
monica| joey, speed it up!|joey| i'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
phoebe| monica, how did this happen? i thought you had this all planned out.|monica| do you want me to cry? is that what you want? do you wanna see me cry?
phoebe| sir! no sir!|monica|  all right, you!
ross| no. look, i told you i am not a part of this thing.|monica| all right, look, ross. i realize that you have issues with carol and susan, and i feel for you, i do. but if you don't help me cook, i'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and i'm gonna create a new appetizer called \pigs in ross\. all right, ball the melon.
chandler| hey! how come i'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.|monica| hi.
carol| how's it going?|monica| it's goin' great. right on schedule. got my little happy helpers.
carol| fine, whatever.|ross| what's the matter?
carol| nothing. ok, everything. i think we're calling off the wedding.|ross| what?
monica| you're still gonna pay me, right? or something a little less selfish.|ross| carol, what's the matter? what happened?
carol| my parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.|ross| oh my god.
carol| i mean, i knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. they're supposed to give me away and everything.|ross| it's ok. i'm sorry.
carol| and then susan and i got in this big fight because i said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if i couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. i don't know what to do.|ross| i uh can't believe i'm gonna say this, but i think susan's right.
carol| you do?|ross| look, do you love her? and you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
carol| of course i do.|ross| well then that's it. and if george and adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. look, this is your wedding. do it.
carol| you're right. of course you're right.|monica| so we're back on?
carol| we're back on.|monica| you heard the woman. peel, chop, devil! i can't believe i lost 2 minutes.
joey| it just seems so futile, you know ? all these women, and nothing. i feel like superman without my powers, you know? i have the cape, and yet i cannot fly.|chandler| well now you understand how i feel every single day, ok? the world is my lesbian wedding.
phoebe|  butterscotch? no one? all right, you'll be sorry later.|carol| thank you.
ross| any time. |carol| ross. 
minister| you know, nothing makes god happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. friends, family, we're gathered here today to join carol and susan in holy matrimony.|phoebe|  whoa, she's gone. she's gone. she's gone! go ahead, get married. go, go.
monica| would you look at them?|ross| yeah, can't help but.
joey|  i wrapped those bad boys.|phoebe| i miss rose. 
chandler| oh, yeah? |phoebe| i know it's kind of weird, but i mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now i just feel kind of alone.
woman| you know, i uh, i couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and i think it's time for you to forget about rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?|phoebe| ok, that's so nice.
chandler| |rachel| hey, mom? having fun?
mrs green| oh, am i! i just danced with a wonderfully large woman. and three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. oh, i'm not saying it's something i wanna pursue, but it's nice to know i have options.|rachel| there's more alcohol, right?
susan| how you doin'?|ross| ok.
susan| you did a good thing today.|ross| yeah.
susan| you wanna dance?|ross| no, that's fine.
susan| come on. i'll let you lead.|ross| ok.
chandler| |monica| ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
ross| well, mon, i was married.|phoebe| yeah, me, too, technically.
rachel| i had a wedding.|monica| all right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
joey| i got one. which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? |chandler| isn't ben in this?
all| did not, she did not wink at you....|chandler| huh. 
ross| i have to say tupolo honey by van morrison.|rachel| nooo way! the most romantic song ever is the way we were.
phoebe| see, i-i think that one that elton john wrote for, um, that guy on who's the boss.|rachel| what song was that, pheebs?
phoebe|  hold me close, young tony dan-za.|phoebe| hi monica!
ross| hey mon!|rachel| hey mon!
phoebe| oh my god, has she slept at all?|ross| nope.
rachel| no, it's been three nights in a row.|ross| yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
phoebe| oh, okay that explains it. i got a call at two in the morning, but all i could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so i thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. but then i realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.|chandler| morning.
joey| morning, hey, you made pancakes?|chandler| yeah, like there's any way i could ever do that.
janice|  good morning joey.|joey|  good morning.
chandler| hey, you know what, here's a thought. why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.|janice| oh, i wish. look, honey, you have that report to finish, and i gotta go see my lawyer. 
chandler| i can not believe that i am going out with someone that is getting divorced. i'm such a grown up.|janice|  i-i-i gotta go, i gotta go. okay, not without a kiss.
chandler| well, maybe i won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.|joey|  kiss her! kiss her!
janice| i'll see you later, sweetie. bye joey.|joey| b-bye janice. so when ya' dumpin' her.
chandler| nope, not this time.|joey| come on, quite yankin' me.
chandler| i'm not yanking you.|joey| this is janice.
chandler| yeah, i know. she makes me happy.|joey| okay. all right. you look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. no blinking.
chandler| |monica| god, look what i found in the drain.
rachel| what?!|monica| it's some of richard's hair!  what do i do with this?
ross| getting it away from me would be job one.|monica| it's weird, but you know what i don't wanna throw this away. i mean this is like all i have left of him, gross, drain hair. ooh! 
phoebe| ooh. oh. it looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. |monica| god, what is wrong with me.
ross| you need to get some sleep.|monica| i need to get some richard.
rachel| monica, you broke up with him for a reason.|monica| i know, i know. i'm just so tired of-of missing him. i'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. why hasn't he called!
phoebe| maybe, because you told him not to.|monica| what are you the memory woman?
joey|  their not breaking up. chandler and janice. their not breaking up. he didn't blink or anything.|rachel| well, you know i'm not surprised. i mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.

joey| there you go! that's the spirit i'm looking for! what can we do? huh? all right who's first? huh? ross?|ross| well i'm thinking that chandler's our friend and janice makes him happy, so i say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
joey| yeah, we'll call that plan b. all right?|rachel|  honey, i was wondering....
ross| hmm?|rachel| do you still have that, um, navy uniform?
ross| nooo, i had to return it to the costume place.|rachel| hmm.

ross| princess leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. it was pretty cool.|phoebe| yeah, oh, princess leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
rachel| really!|phoebe| um, um. it's huge. yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
rachel| did you ever do the-the leia thing?|phoebe| oh, yeah, um-mm. oh!

joey| i say, 'i am there!' cool! aw, is ross going to?|chandler| no, janice.
joey| jan-ice. 'cause i, just, i feel bad for ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.|chandler| you know, i may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with janice?
joey| no, yeeees. god, how do i say this. ?|chandler| ooh, that girl that i hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
joey| look, i don't hate janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.|chandler| well, there you go.
joey| oh, hey. come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?|chandler| well, i'm crazy about her now. i think this could be the real thing. capital 'r'! capital 't'!  don't worry, those are the right letters.
joey| look, what do you want me to say?|chandler| i want you to say that you like her!
joey| i can't. it's like this chemical thing, you know. every time she starts laughing, i just wanna  pull my arm off just so that i can have something to throw at her. |chandler| thanks for trying.  oh, and by the way there is no count rushmore!
joey| yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? |ross| how could you have told her? 
rachel| ross, i didn't think it would that big of a deal.|ross| oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
rachel| okay, who are you talking to when you do that?|ross| look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
rachel| okay, ross, phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. you know, i mean, come on, guys do the same thing, i mean, what about all that locker room stuff.|ross| that's different, okay. that's like, uh 'who dated a stripper?' or 'who did it on the back of the staton island ferry?'.
rachel| were both of those joey?|ross| yeah. look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
rachel| not even with your best friend.|ross| noo!
rachel| that is so sad. your missing out on so much, ross. i mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. and-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.|ross| hmph. so what you, you tell each other everything?
rachel| pretty much.|ross| did you talk about the night of five times? do you tell people about the night of five times? 
rachel| uh, honey, yeah that was with carol.|ross| i know, but it's still worth mentioning, i think.
phoebe|  relax every muscle in your body. listen to the plinky-plunky music. okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. okay, tell me your happy place.|monica| richard's living room, drinking wine.
phoebe| all right. no, no, no, not a richard thing, just put down the glass. and get out!|monica| i'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
phoebe| well, okay, fine, use my happy place. okay, i'm just gonna, i have to ask that you don't move anything.|monica| all right, i'll try not to.
phoebe| okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....|monica| do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
phoebe| all right, there are no questions in the happy place. okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....|monica| i'll bet he's totally over me, i'll bet he's fine.
phoebe| all right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, i'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. okay. just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. and the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....|monica| okay, this isn't working. i'm still awake and now i have to pee.
janice| so, i hear, you hate me!|joey| i, ah, i never said hate, i was very careful about that.
janice| a little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.|joey| and you got a 'hate' from that?! your taking a big leap there...
janice| all right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here joey. so, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.|joey| but what does that gonna do...

janice| okay. all right. this is what we're gonna call it: 'joey and janice's day of fun!'|joey| does it have to be a whole day?
janice| yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.|joey| yeah, i know, i sleep in the next room.
monica|  so, i went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that i ordered for richard about the civil war. he loved the civil war.|phoebe| monica, do you want us to take you home?

chandler| i know, and then all of the sudden your mom pops into your head. and your like 'mom, get outta here!' you know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. so it's kinda like, you're, you know. you know.... you don't know!|ross| your mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your mom, what is the matter with you?

monica| was he crying?|mr. geller| no.
monica| well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?|mr. geller| maybe.
monica| i think so.|mr. geller| honey, relationships are hard. like with your mom and me. you know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. it seems her father, your grandfather, wanted her to travel around europe, like he did. of course, he got to do it on uncle sam's nickel, because he was also strafing german troop trains at the time. however, 
rachel| okay, here we go. i'm jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. what? honey, what is it? did i get it wrong? did i get the hair wrong? what? did you just picture it differently? what? what?|ross| no, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's

monica| so, should i call him back?|the guys|
chandler| all right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair.  i'm soooo, comfortable.|joey| me too. in fact, i think i might be a little too comfortable.

monica| here, i got it. i'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.|joey| monica, how are you gonna do that?
monica| i know the code to his answering machine.|ross| okay, mon, i really don't think this is the... okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.

joey| hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.|joey| now she sounded breezy.
monica| he's seeing someone. i can't believe he's seeing someone.|phoebe| monica, you don't know that.
monica| well, who's voice was that?|chandler| maybe it was his sister's. you know, maybe it was his daughter's.
monica| michelle! of course, it was michelle! did it sound like michelle?|ross| oh, great. it's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
monica| it was michelle. it was definitely michelle.|rachel| pheebs, you go with monica and try on her green dress. if that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. oh, gosh, what am i wearing?!
ross| you don't, you don't know what your wearing?|rachel| well, hon-ey. i'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
ross| yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. all right, come on, i'll just pick something out for you.|chandler| all right, you will notice that i am fully dressed. i, in turn, have noticed that you are not. so in the words of a. a. milne, \get out of my chair, dillhole!\
joey| okay. |chandler| what are you doing?
joey| you said i had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.|chandler| the cushions are the essence of the chair!
joey| that's right! i'm taking the essence.|chandler| oh-ho, it'll be back. oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
ross| look, i'm sorry, i thought it looked pretty.|rachel| ross, that was a halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as little bo peep.
ross| look, i didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.|rachel| yeah, which, by the way chandler, i would like back one of these days.
phoebe| oh rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me! |rachel| oh, it's perfect! but not for tonight.
phoebe| well, of course not for tonight. yeah, hi!|ross| not for tonight. not for tonight! wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
rachel| no honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. i love you. i love you.|chandler| we used them as pillows when we went camping.

ross| hey, what you do on your own time...|joey|  where's my underwear?!
ross| whoa, whoa, whoa. come on, come on, what. you took his underwear?|chandler| he took my essence!
ross| okay, now hold on. joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?|joey| because, i'm not wearing any underwear now.
ross| okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?|joey| it's a rented tux. okay. i'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
chandler| well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.|joey| okay, you hide my clothes. i'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
chandler| what are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?|joey| hey, opposite, is opposite! 
chandler| he's got nothing!|phoebe|  okay, i'm ready.
phoebe| rachel, didn't have anything that i liked, so, but she had this christmas ribbon, and i thought, 'all right, fine i'll be political.'|chandler| what are you supporting?
phoebe| duh!! christmas!|ross| okay, hey, that's okay with me. two down and i have exactly twelve minutes.... wha, my watch stopped. my watch.  what time is it? it's 7:33, i have seven minutes. i have seven minutes!!
rachel|  okay, pheebs, quick, what shoes should i wear? the black or the purple?|ross| just, just, just pick one!
phoebe| okay, okay, okay, the black. but, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?|rachel| yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. maybe i should wear pants?
ross| yeah, pants, what, what an idea. or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. look, i don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. no, no i don't care if they match. i don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. okay.|rachel| but i...
ross| no, no, no just do it. go in there and pick something out so we can go.|rachel| all right.
ross| thank you!|monica|  okay. i gotta call michelle. i gotta see if that was her voice or not. i'm sorry, i just have to.
ross| it was, it was her voice.|chandler| monica, i think you've gone over to the bad place.
michelle||monica| okay. that was her right?
phoebe| definitely.|monica| see there you go. woo! we're out of the woods. okay, i'll get dressed now.
ross| yay!|phoebe| i'll get it, okay.  oh, ew, it's michelle! ew! she, she must have that caller id thing. you should get that. 
monica|  oh, you're so sweet. yeah, we were a great couple. i know i really miss him. well, you know how it is, it's that....|chandler|  you know what's weird. donald duck never wore pants. but whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. i mean, what is that about?
monica|  that bitch always hated me. i'm calling her back.|ross| no, no, no, no. tick, tick, tick, tick.
monica| okay, fine. |chandler| they got a phone in there, right?
phoebe| okay, we're on it. we're on it.|ross| um. i know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
rachel| i'm not gonna gooo.|ross| you're not going to go.
rachel| no, i think i'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.|ross| how, how, um how can you not be going?
rachel| i'm not gonna gooo, so i think that will accomplish the not going.|ross| um, you know, just out of curiosity...
rachel| well, ever since i was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, i'm just, i don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.|ross| right. right, okay, okay. i'm sorry. i'm sorry i yelled.
rachel| it's fine.|ross| no, but, your-your mad.
rachel| i'm not mad. |ross| no.
rachel| i'm just not going.|ross| your not going.
rachel| right.|ross| okay. you know that i-i have to go.
rachel| um, hum.|ross| right. so is it gonna be like 'i'm abandoning you while your upset.'
rachel| no.|ross| no, because your not upset.
rachel| right.|ross| about the yelling.

rachel| um, hum.|ross| we're good.
rachel| right.|ross| okay. honey?
rachel| yes, ross. |ross| i love you. 
phoebe|  she's just getting dressed.|chandler| is it wrong that i was totally aroused by that?
joey| okay, buddy-boy. here it is. you hide my clothes, i'm wearing everything you own.|chandler| oh my god! that is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!! 
joey| look at me! i'm chandler! could i be wearing any more clothes? maybe if i wasn't going commando...|chandler| oooo-ooh!

chandler| jeez, what a baby.|joey| yeah, ross, way to ruin it. i was just going to get dressed.
ross| you know what i don't care. the only person i cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. look rach, i'm sorry. okay. look, i-i wa, i was a jerk. i'm sorry i yelled. i want you there, i need you there. look, what, what can i do that can show you how much, how much i want you to be there.|joey| you could drink the fat.
ross| hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.|rachel| no, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. that actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
ross| what?|rachel| i think you should drink the fat.
joey| yaaaay!|ross| okay, okay. if that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much i want you there. then that's what i'll do.
phoebe| oh, wait, let me get you another glass. that's been sitting out.|ross| i think this will be fine. okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. cheers. 
rachel| no, no, no, wait! okay, okay. don't! i'll go, i'll go!|ross| you will?!
rachel| you were really gonna do that, weren't you?|ross| well, yeah.
rachel| you were gonna drink the fat.|joey| let's see what else he'll do!
ross|  you, give him back his underwear! i'm gonna go get a cab, and i want everyone down stairs in two minutes! monica! |chandler| stop it. stop it!

joey| what is this? fruit?|rachel| monica's making jam.
joey| whoa, jam! i love jam!  hey, how come we never have jam at our place?|chandler| because the kids need new shoes.

chandler| okay, well. janice said 'hi, do i look fat today?' and i, i looked at her....|ross| whoa, whoa, whoa. you looked at her. you never look. you just answer, it's just a reflex. do i look fat? nooo! is she prettier than i am? noo! does size matter?
rachel| nooo!|ross| and it works both ways.
chandler| okay, so you both just know this stuff?|rachel| well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
ross| okay, for instance. let's say, janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. which do you do?|chandler| that's easy, baggage claim.
ross|  wrong! now you're single. it's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. that way she knows you love her.|chandler| okay, this is good, this is good. all right listen, i have one. janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know i'm all for. but, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. so, uh, how do i tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
rachel| oh honey, i'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers.  okay, i'm late for work.|ross| oh.
rachel| all right are you guys gonna come down?|ross| uh, yeah, yeah i'll, i'm right behind you.
rachel| good luck chandler.|chandler| thank you rachel.
ross| bye sweetie.|rachel| bye hon.
ross|  okay the sleeping thing. very tricky business, but there is something you can do.|chandler| well, i thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
ross| noo! no, not cuddlily, not me, just her. i'm like you, i need the room. okay, come here.  okay, you're in bed...|chandler| yeah. 
ross| i'm gonna use the cushion.|chandler| yeah.
ross| okay, you're in bed. she's over on your side, cuddling. now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. and then you rollll a-way. hug for her! roll for you.|chandler| okay, the old hug and roll.
ross| yep.|chandler| okay, one question.
ross| shoot.|chandler| you're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
joey| remember when you where a kid and your mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?|rachel|  you're so pretty.
phoebe|  hi!|all| hey, phoebe.
phoebe| hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? i talked to him today.|joey|  you talked to him. are you crazy?
phoebe| okay, first i'm not crazy. and second, say it don't spray it. anyway his name is malcom, and he wasn't following me, i mean he was, but 'cause he thought i was ursula, ick. and, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'cause of the restraining order.|chandler| umm, not feeling better 'bout malcom.
phoebe| ooh! no, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. he's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. and we just get along really well, and he's so cute.|ross| oh my god, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
phoebe| no, i'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-ursula-ized', like you know, like i did for joey after he went out with her.|joey|  
phoebe| okay, i asked for the news, not the weather.|monica|  hey guys.
all| hey mon.|monica| joey, this is for you.  it's blackberry curin.
joey| aww.  ohh!|chandler| hey, joe, i gotta ask. the girl from the xerox place buck naked 
joey| put your hands together.|monica| joey, take your time with that. that's my last batch.
joey| no more jam?!|rachel| well, what happened to your jam plan?
monica| i figured out i need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. so, i've got a new plan now. babies.|chandler| well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
ross| what are you talking about?|monica| i'm talking about me having a baby.
ross| what?|rachel| are you serious?
monica| yeah. the great thing about the jam plan was, i was taking control of my life. so i asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when i came up with the baby plan. |ross| well, aren't you forgetin' something? what, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? dad!
monica| it took me 28 years to find one man that i wanna spend my life with, if i have to wait another 28 years then, i'll be 56 before i can have a baby, and that's just stupid.|chandler| that, that's what's stupid.
monica| i don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. and there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.|rachel| down at the docks again?
janice| night-night bing-a-ling.|chandler| night-night.....janice. 
malcom| here's my binoculars.|phoebe| oh, great. great. you're doing great, you know real strong. going strong. keep going.
malcom| these are my night vision goggles. this is the book i pretend to read when i'm watching her in the park. and these are mad lips, they're just for fun.|phoebe| oh, yeah. what's this? 
malcom| oh, this is log i kept, recording her every movement. do you wanna here something from it?|phoebe| um, not even a little bit.
malcom| it's about you.|phoebe| oh, okay then.
malcom|  i met phoebe today. she was really nice to me eventhough i'm such a loser. and, then when i was walking home i thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.|phoebe| good. so what were you thinking?
malcom| i was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.|phoebe| really?
malcom| no.|phoebe| oh.
malcom| see that's just something i said now, so that maybe i could kiss you.|phoebe| oh, okay. 
chandler| no, that's all right. i just had a jar of mustard.|monica|  okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! okay, he's 6'2\, 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male geena davis.
chandler| you mean there's more than one of us.|ross| look, you can't do this mon. all right, if you do this, i'm, i'm gonna, i'm, i'm gonna.....
monica| you're gonna what?|ross| i'm gonna tell mom.
rachel| honey, i'm sorry, but he's right. i love you, but you're crazy.|ross| crazy.
monica| what?! why? why is this crazy? so this isn't the ideal way to something....|ross|  oh, it's not the ideal way...
monica| lips moving, still talking. i mean it may not be ideal, but i'm so ready. no, i-i-i see the way ben looks at you. it makes me ache, you know?|joey| check it out!! jam crackers!
monica| okay, all right, how's this? 27. italian-american guy. he's an actor, born in queens. wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy.  oh my god, under personal comments: 'new york knicks, rule!'|joey| yeah, the knicks rule!
monica| joey, this is you!|joey| let me see.  oh, right.
rachel| when did you go to a sperm bank?|joey| well, right after i did that sex study down at nyu.  hey, remember that sweater i gave you for your birthday?
chandler| and that's how you bought it?|joey| noooo, that's what i was wearing when i donated. i'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
monica| well, honey, it is pretty competitive. i mean i've got an actual rocket scientist here.|joey| maybe, i should call this place and get them to put my 'days of our lives' on here. you know, juice this puppy up a little.
phoebe|  hellooo!|all| hey.
ross| how's the maniac?|phoebe| oh, well he's yummy. we did a little kissin'.
rachel| phoebe, what are you doing?|phoebe| oh, no, no, no, no. you know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. he quit for me.
rachel| pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for god knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.|phoebe| look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
ross| you're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?|phoebe| what, he's not still following her. do you think he is still following her?
chandler| pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.|phoebe| what are you saying i should do?
monica| i think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.|phoebe| thank you, monica.
joey| orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.|monica| oh, that's what i would do, forget mine.
rachel| oh my god, what happened? |janice| oh. god, crazy chandler. he spun me...off...the...bed!
rachel| wow! spinning that sounds like fun.|janice| oh,  i wish. no, you know he was just trying ross's hug and roll thing. 
rachel|  ross's what?|janice| you know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... oh... my....god.
malcom| phoebe?|phoebe| yes? yes! oh.
malcom| what are you doing?|phoebe| oh, i was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. oh, here it is! oh. 
malcom| were you following me?|phoebe| um, perhaps. yes! yes, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. i was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
malcom| so you spied on me. i can't believe you don't trust me. |phoebe| oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. just walkin' along looking like me. what, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
malcom| i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i tried to stop, but i couldn't. i'm so pathetic.|phoebe| no, no, it's not your fault. you know it's partly my fault, 'cause i made you quit cold turkey. sorry, no. okay, well, i mean, i can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know  wow! but um, but i will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. okay, stalk me for a while. huh? yeah, and, and, and, i'll be like an ursula patch.
malcom| uh-huh, i don't know.|phoebe| yeah, just, okay, look i'm going. um, come on. op, op, behind the pillar, which way am i gonna go? 
joey| hey.|monica| hey.
joey| where you going?|monica| to the bank.
joey| sperm or regular?|monica| sperm.
joey| so you're really doing this, huh?|monica| oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135. 
joey| sounds nice.|monica| 'fraid so. brown hair, green eyes...
joey| no kiddin', hmm. |monica| what?
joey| no, i-i figured you would've picked a blond guy.|monica| really? why?
joey| i don't know, i just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... hoyt.|monica| hoyt?
joey| it's a name, yeah. i saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.|monica| really, is he a swimmer?
joey| he's got the body for it.|monica| i like that.  what?
joey| you guys have one of those signs that says: 'we don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.|monica| we do not have one of those signs.
joey| sure you do, it was a gift from me. oh! and you have these three great kids.|monica| two girls and a boy?
joey| yeah!|monica| and, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. and they're, they're running around on the deck. then hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
joey| sure!  but hey, you know this way sounds good too. |monica| yeah.
joey| oh monica. .|joey| i called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of tribianni. nobody wants my product. i mean, i-i-i don't get it  maybe if they met me in person.
rachel| honey, you got a little thing on your...|joey|  did i get it?
rachel| yeah.|ross|  hello. 
rachel| hello.|ross|  uh, chan, can i uh, can i talk to you for a second?
chandler| sure. what's up?|ross| just one uh, one additional relationship thought. probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk! 
host| welcome everybody, welcome to amazing discoveries!|phoebe| oh, oh! it's on again!
joey| you guys, can we please not watch this all right.|all| shhhh!
host| folks, has this ever happened to you. you go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.|joey|  aw! there's got to be a better way!
mike| and there is kevin.|joey| can we please turn this off?
rachel| noo way, kevin.|mike| there is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. meet the milk master 2000.
ross|  are you intrigued?|chandler| you're flingin'-flangin' right i am!
mike| keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.  this works with any milk carton.|joey|  now, i can have milk everyday.
chandler| well, it's official there are no good movies.|janice| well, let's go to a bad one and make out. 
monica| perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back.|joey|  hey!
phoebe| hey.|chandler| hey, man. what's up?
joey| maybe you can tell me. my agent would like to know why i didn't show up at the audition i didn't know i had today. the first good thing she gets me in weeks. how could you not give me the message?!|chandler| well, i'll tell ya i do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
phoebe| yes, it was! it was him! uh huh!  okay, it was me! |joey| how is it you?
phoebe| well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. i mean, chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and i hadn't found a place to hide yet. i-i-i meant to tell you, and i wrote it all down on my hand. see, all of it. |joey| yep, that's my audition.
monica| see, now this is why i keep notepads everywhere.|phoebe| yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
janice| what is the great tragedy here? you go get yourself another appointment.|joey| well, estelle tried, you know. the casting director told her that i missed my chance.
phoebe| that is unfair. i'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.|joey| pheebs, you can't do that. the casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
phoebe| what a sad little life she must lead. okay, ooh . |joey| what, what are you doing? what are you doing?
phoebe| no, no, no, i know, i know, ooh.  'hi, this is katelynn, from phoebe buffay's office. um, is um, ann there for phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'|joey| hang up, hang up. 
phoebe|  'annie! hi. listen we got a problem with joey tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. who did you speak to in my office? estelle, no, i don't know what i'm going to do with her. no. all right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'|chandler| is anybody else scared?
phoebe| |chandler| get the woman a pad! get the woman a pad! a pad! a pad!
monica| oh, now you want a pad.|carol and susan|  hey!!
ross| there's my boy! here's my boy! and here's his barbi  what's ah, what's my boy doing with a barbi?|carol| he picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
susan| he carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.|ross| yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. why, why, why does he have it, again?
susan| so he's got a doll? so what? unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.|carol| this doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
ross| you know what it's fine. if you're okay with the barbi thing, so am i.|ross| give daddy the barbi! ben, give, give me the barbi. okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? 
rachel| ross, you are so pathetic. why can't your son just play with his doll? |monica|  i gotta go to work. has anybody seen my left boob?
joey| i love that movie. |monica| there it is. joey, what are you doing?
joey| i'm sorry, it just felt nice.|chandler|  joe. joe! answer the phone.
joey| hey, i only got one good arm, you know. you should be doing stuff for me. go get me a sweater.|chandler| just do it! okay, it's janice and if i get it i'm going to have to see her tonight.  oh, that's great i'm gonna have to see her tonight.
rachel| what's the big deal? why don't you wanna see janice?|chandler| okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
ross| and that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?|chandler| noo.
ross| you didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.|chandler| no, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. and this alarm started going off in my head: 'run for your life! get out of the building!'
rachel| men are unbelievable.|monica| what is it with you people! i mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
chandler| i know, that,  that's why i don't want to go tonight, i'm afraid i'm going to say something stupid.|monica| oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
joey| hey, you know about that?!|chandler| look what do i do? i wanna get past this, i don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. i wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! 
ross|  where there is no fear of commitment.|chandler| do we have any... do we have any thoughts here?
joey| well, i've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as i understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. but, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. it have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! if you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. right. in this case, you have a fear of commitment, so i say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.|rachel| amazingly, that makes sense.
chandler| you think?|joey| oh, yeah. go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
chandler| yeah, joe, i assure you if i'm staring down the barrel of a gun, i'm pretty much peeing every which way.|phoebe| oh, it's your audition from this morning. can i use the phone again?
rachel| sure pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.|joey| come on baby, come on!
phoebe|  'hi, i have phoebe buffay returning a page. okay, well, um, she's in her car i'll have to patch you through.'|rachel| very nice touch.
phoebe|  op, went through a tunnel.|rachel| unbelievable.
joey| thank you so much.|phoebe| it was really fun, i mean i've never talked on a car phone before.
joey| you were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that i really, really want, and estelle couldn't get me in.|phoebe| oh, i don't know. i mean it was fun one time.
joey| come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.|phoebe| two?
joey| yeah! well, well really it's three. please. you're so good at it. i love you.|phoebe| okay, i'll do it, but just these three, right
joey| nooo, four.|janice| so, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
chandler| 'cause, i wanted to uh, give you this. |janice| ohhh, are you a puppy!  contact paper! i never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
chandler| well, wait there's, there's more. see the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.  see, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.|janice| oh, you didn't have to do this.
chandler| yes, i did. yes, i did. because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get. |janice| well, i gotta buy a vowel. because, oh my gawd! who, would've thought that someday, chandler bing would buy me a drawer.
chandler| well, not me. but that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. we should take a trip.|janice| we should?
chandler| yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. and, i wanna meet your parents. we should take a trip with your parents!|janice|  i don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! are you okay?
chandler| i am, i actually am. i mean this is amazing. my entire life i have feared this place, and now that i'm here it's like what was the big deal. i could probably say 'let's move in together.' and i'd be okay.|janice| you probably want us to move in together?
chandler| it doesn't scare me!|janice| yeah, well, it scares me! i mean i not even divorced yet, chandler. you know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. and, and i wasn't even that hungry. you know what, it's getting a little late, and i-i should just, um...
chandler| oh, no, no, no, don't go! i've scared ya'! i've said too much! i'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! |rachel| honey, this will help. 
chandler| so, i finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.|rachel and monica| uff.
monica| that is never good.|chandler| then i got all needy and clingy.
rachel| okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. maybe it's not so bad. how did you leave it?|chandler| she said she'd call me.
rachel and monica| ohh! |chandler| oh god.
monica| welcome to our side of the tunnel.|chandler| this ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
rachel| yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. we sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.|monica| you know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
rachel| yeah, you do.|chandler| so, you don't think i'm terminal?
monica| well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.|chandler| okay, okay. so, should i call her?
rachel and monica| nooo!|rachel| this is a very critical time right now. if you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. you want her back you have to start acting aloof.
monica| she has to know that your not ready.|rachel| right. so, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. and then act aloof.
chandler| so i'm not, not gonna lose her?|rachel| oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
chandler| i said, 'so i'm not gonna lose her?'|rachel| oh.
ross| guess who's here. it's the toughest guy in toy land, ben.  'a real american hero. i'm g.i. joe!' drop the barbi, drop the barbi.|rachel| g.i. joe? do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
joey|  g. i. joe! cool! can i play?|ross| look ben, it's a toy that protects u.s. oil interests overseas!
joey and ross| go joe!!!|phoebe| 
joey| pheebs! there you are!|phoebe| no it's not, sorry.
joey| but phoebe, wait! wait! phoebe. phoebe! |phoebe| oh, joey! oh, okay, see i didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
joey| look listen, that tv movie i went in for? did you hear anything? i think i got a shot at it.|phoebe| yes! they called and you didn't get it! okay, i mean you didn't get it, i'm sorry, i'm sorry.
joey| it's okay, these things happen.|phoebe| but they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. oh god, i don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
joey| i'm, i'm okay. see. |phoebe| oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. you know what, i, i'm sorry i quit, okay, i just quit.
joey| no! no, no you can't quit! you're the best agent i ever had! look pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.|phoebe| not personal, really, well they said that they never met an italian actor with a worse italian accent.
joey| they actually said that?|phoebe| yeah. ooh god, there's that face again! see i can't do this job! i...
joey| no, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. you know, estelle just says stuff like 'they went another way', but this, i can use this.  i canna work on a new accent.|phoebe| yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. yeah.
ross| |janice|  chandler!
chandler|  hello, janice.|janice| what are you doing here?
chandler|  oh, just a bit of shopping. how've you been?|janice| are you being british?!
chandler|  no. not anymore.|janice| why are you shopping here? you don't live in this neighborhood. were you here waiting for me?
chandler| yeah, huh. i'm just uh, you know i'm just picking up some things for a party. |janice| barley? what kind of party serves barley?
chandler| well, i'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.|janice| where is this party?
chandler| here in chelsea.|janice| who's party is it?
chandler| a woman's|janice| what woman?!
chandler|  chelsea.|janice| okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that i could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. so like which of these two guys do you want to be? 
chandler| can i be that guy?|phoebe| okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. 
joey| okay, shoot.|phoebe| okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
joey| i didn't get it?|phoebe| no. they said you 'weren't believable as a human being.' so, you can work on that. 
joey| okay, what else?|phoebe| um, the off-broadway play people said 'you were pretty but dumb.'
joey| oh.|phoebe| oh no wait, i'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
joey| look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, i really appreciate this pheebs, but i think i'm gonna have to go back to estelle.|phoebe| oh.
joey| yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her i don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.|phoebe| yeah, no, i understand.
joey| you do, thanks.|phoebe| yeah. sorry. 
joey| wait a minute.|phoebe| what?
joey| wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.|phoebe|  oh, you caught me. i am so busted.
joey|  that's-ah what i suspected-ah.|chandler| ....and then i just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
monica| my god! chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.|chandler| i've actually ruined this haven't i? it's time for the good ice cream now, right?
rachel| yeah, it is.|monica| you know what, everything's gonna be okay. 
chandler|  okay, what do i do?|rachel| shhh...i don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
monica| if-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.|rachel| yeah.
chandler| hello!|monica| oh wait, you know what, i got it, i got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. be sleepy.
rachel| yes, and grumpy.|chandler| what are you, stop naming dwarves!  really?!
rachel| he's soo lucky, if janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.|chandler|  i love you too.
monica| aw, it's soo unfair. |carol| g. i. joe. g. i. joe?!
ross| hey, i don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.|susan| what'd you do, dip it in sugar?
ross| look, g. i. joe's in, barbi's out. and if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'|monica| what are you being such a weenie for? so he has a barbi, big deal. you used to dress up like a woman.
ross| what?|monica| well, you used to dress up in mom's clothes all the time.

phoebe|  thats why i moved out.|ross| hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you dont live here anymore.
phoebe| i think on some levels she already knows.|ross| phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that youve been living with your grandmothers for a week now.
phoebe| okay, well maybe not on those levels.|chandler|  hey.
ross| hey.|chandler| im never gonna find a roommate, ever.
phoebe| why, nobody good?|chandler| well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural. the spitter. oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. nice to meet you, chandler bing bing! great apartment chandler bing, bing!
ross| so how many more do you have tomorrow?|chandler| two. this photographer, who seemed really dull. and this actor guy, who im not sure about, because when he called and i answered the phone chandler bing, he said whoa-whoa, short message.

phoebe| oh, really?|ross| yeah, y'know how i have you guys, well she doesnt really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, susan something, and they really hit it off, and i-i-i think its gonna make a difference
chandler| soo, ah, eric, what kind of photography do ya do?|eric| oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, i hope thats cool.
chandler| yes, that is cool. because i have models here y'know......never.|eric| oh, yeah, during the summer, i spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. although, i should probably tell you, shes a porn star.

ross| well, hes finally alseep. about that ah, bump on his head?|rachel| are you, are you, are you sure its ah, a new bump? i mean, no offense, ive always thought of ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
ross| its okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, i figured you did the best you could.|rachel|  i did!
ross| i know! im saying you have to watch them all the time.|rachel| i did!! i watched! i watched! i watched monica bang his head against that thing!
ross| monica did it?|ross| monica?
monica| yeah.|ross| umm, did you notice anything wierd about ben today?
monica| no. why?|ross| well, i was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly hes leaving out e and f. its like they just ah, i dont know, fell out of his head.
monica| really?!|ross| oh, and also, hes, hes walkin kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and hes in there just sort of y'know...  
monica| oh my god, i wrecked your baby!! |rachel| i hope its still funny when youre in hell.
monica| |ross| monica bang! monica bang!  ow!
rachel| ill get the hat.|chandler| janice, i have something i need to tell you, and i want you to let me get through it, because its, its, its not gonna be easy.
janice| okay.|chandler| i think you should go back with gary. i dont wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. whenever i would see him i was always think y'know youre the reason, you are the reason why their not together. and i hated that guy. and it didnt matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my dad.
janice| wow!|chandler| yeah, well. its the right thing to do.
janice| oh! youre right. oh god. but, before i can say good-bye, theres something i really need you to know, chandler. the way i feel about you, its like, i finally understand what lionel richies been singing about. y'know, i mean what we have, its like movie love, youre my soulmate, and i cant believe were not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.|chandler| then dont leave me!
janice| what?|chandler| forget what i said, i was babbling! pick me!

joey| and i gotta go sell some christmas trees.|phoebe| have fun. oh wait, no, dont! i forgot i am totally against that now.
joey| what? me having a job?|phoebe| no, no, i am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights.  hey, how do you sleep at night?
joey| well, im pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. hey, phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. those trees were born to be christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.|phoebe| really?
chandler| yes. yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, its the only chance to see new york.|gunther| ...and after youve delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
rachel| gunther, gunther, please, ive worked here for two and a half years, i know the empty trays go over there. |gunther| what if you put them here. 
rachel| huh. well, y'know thats actually a really good idea, because that way theyll be closer to the mugs. y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.|gunther| they already do. thats why they call it the tray spot.
rachel| gee, i always heard them talk about that, i just always thought that it was a club they went to. oh god, im, im sorry. |gunther| its all right. sweetheart.
ross| so, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? i mean, your dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore. |sarah| well, i kinda wanted to sell the cookies. the girl who sells the most wins a trip to spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
ross| wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?|sarah| yeah. my dad says if i spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as i do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the taj mahal.
ross| i think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to india.|sarah| no. the one in atlantic city, dad loves the slots. he says hes gonna double the college money my grandma left me.
ross| huh. well, good luck to dad. say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?|sarah| the girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
ross| yeah.|sarah| so far, ive sold seventy-five.
ross| four hundred, huh? well, that sounds do-able.  how much are the boxes?|sarah| five dollars a box.
ross|  and what is second prize?|sarah| a ten speed bike. but, id rather have something my dad couldnt sell.
ross| well, that makes sense.|sarah| could you do me one favor, if its not too much trouble?
ross| yeah, sarah, anything.|sarah| could you pull open the curtains for me? the astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we dont have a tv, the lady across the alley said shed push hers up to a window, so i could watch it.
woman|  yesss?|ross| hi, im selling brown bird cookies.
woman| youre no brown bird, i can see you through my peephole.|ross| no, hi, im, im an honorary brown bird 
woman| what does that mean?|ross| ah, well, it means that i can sell cookies, but im not invited to sleep-overs.
woman| i can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. now, go away!|ross| no, please, please, um, its for a poor little girl who wants to go to spacecamp more than anything in the world.
woman| im pressing, a policeman is on his way.|ross| okay, okay! im going. im going. 
woman| i can still see you!|ross| all right!!
phoebe|  hey.|joey| hey. what, what are you doing here?
phoebe| well, i-i thought a lot about what you said, and um, i realilized duh, all right maybe i was a little judgmental. yeah,  oh, but oh...|joey| look now, phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their christmas....
phoebe| destiny.|joey| sure.
phoebe| yes.|joey| all right.
phoebe| okay.  yikes! that one doesnt look very fulfilled.|joey| oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just taking it to the back.
phoebe| you keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.|joey| well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
phoebe| so, what happens to the old guys?|joey| well, they go into the chipper.
phoebe| why, do i have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds? |joey| 
ross| ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite christmas characters, santa, rudolph, and baby jesus.|joey| all right, ill take a box of the cream filled jesuss.
ross| wait a minute, one box! come on, im trying to send a little girl to spacecamp, im putting you down for five boxes. chandler, what about you?|chandler| ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
ross| no, but ah, theres coconut in the hanukkah menoreoes. i tell you what, ill put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.|ross| mon?
monica| all right, ill take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and thats it. i-i started gaining weight after i joined the brown birds.  remember, how dad bought all my boxes and i ate them all?|ross| ah, no mon, dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. but ah, y'know im sure thats not gonna happen this time, why dont i put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the rudolphs.

joey| if you ask me, as long as you got this job, youve got nothing pushing you to get another one. you need the fear.|rachel| the fear?
chandler| hes right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.|rachel| well then how come youre still at a job that you hate, i mean why dont you quit and get the fear?
chandler| because, im too afraid.|rachel| i dont know, i mean i would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... oh, i just dont want to be 30 and still work here.
chandler| yeah, thatd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.|gunther| rachel?
rachel| yeah.|gunther| remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
rachel| cant i just look at the handles on them?|gunther| you would think.

phoebe| yeah, it's a vase. |monica| yeah, just like the one in the poem. 
phoebe| well not exactly like the one in the poem. |monica| what do you mean? 
phoebe| remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? oh.  |monica|  so! i'm just an empty vase, huh? 
julio| what? |monica| y'know, so i don't read as many important books as you do, and i don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. and y'know what, i get excited about stupid stuff, like when i my people magazine comes on saturday, and the new hold everything catalog. y'know but that does not mean that i'm empty, i care about things. i care about my friends and family. you have no right to make that kind of judgment about me. 
julio| whoa, whoa, whoa. |monica| you don't even know me... 
julio| whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you. |monica| what? 
julio| the empty vase is not about you. my baby, you make me so sad that you would think this. |monica| i'm sorry, my friend phoebe... 
julio| no, it's about all women. well, all american women. you feel better now? |monica|  oh yeah. 
director| all right, let's do it! |director| no, no, no. what was that? 
joey| i know, it was the best i could get out of them. |director| well, people! 
joey| people, people, people. |director| let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch joey.  count it off. 
rachel| so ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night? |chandler| oh yeah, yeah! look what i got, look what i got.  see, she's fully dressed, right? 
rachel| right. |chandler| and then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. and then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. she's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and  
ross|  hi. |rachel| hello. 
chandler| y'know what, i'm, i'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen. |ross|  i'm sorry, i was an idiot. 
rachel| a big idiot. |ross| a big idiot. just you have to realize is, this whole mark thing is kinda hard for me. 
rachel| honey, why is it hard, i mean we've been together for almost a year now? |ross| well, i was with carol for like eight years and i lost her. and now if it's possible i think i love you even more. so, it's hard for me to believe that i'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away. 
gunther| let it be me! let it be me! |rachel| honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.  
ross| i gotta get going. bye chandler. |chandler| oh, okay ross. listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn? 
rachel| where ya going? |ross| oh, i've got to go pick up ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.

ross| ahh, no. |rachel| oh.  
ross| are you jealous? |rachel| noo, i y'know i don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. i mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? 
ross| you are totally jealous. |rachel| i'm not jealous. all right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. and y'know, and um, i... 
ross| honey, i love you too. |rachel| ugh. wait, wait, wait. 
ross| what? |ross| huh. 
rachel|  well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know. |chandler| yeah. either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.

joey| all right!! okay, it was like four years ago. okay, ginger and i had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her dads cabin. just me, her, and her annoying little dog pepper. well that night, i cooked this really romantic dinner....|monica| you gave her food poisoning!?
joey| i wish. no. after dinner, me, her, and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. well i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out. so, i picked up a log and threw it on. or, at least what i thought was a log.|phoebe| oh my god!! you threw pepper on the fire!
joey| i wish. see, i guess another thing i probably shouldve told you about ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.|monica| oh my god! joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
joey| i ran!!|chandler| well, thats the best kiss ive had with anyone ive ever met in a mens room.

ross| thats a little clearer.|rachel| honey see, it doesnt mean that i dont love you. because i do. i love you, i love you so much. but my work its-its for me y'know, im out there, on my own, and im doing it and its scary but i love it, because its mine. i, but, i mean is that okay?

leslie| no, no, i dont want to forget it.|phoebe| okay y'know what you have to choose. all right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have smelly cat, but we wont be partners. so whats it gonna be?

monica| okay, all right dont judge me to much. okay? um, but i saw this info-mercial, and um, i swear to you i have never-ever bought anything on tv before, except for this mop. but there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....|phoebe| waxine!!
monica| yes! have you seen it?|phoebe| oh, its incredible! i so want to be a waxine girl.
monica| i know!!|phoebe| god. do think it really doesnt hurt? cause how can they do that?
monica| hello! organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!|phoebe| they have the best stuff in there.
chandler| oh my god! oh my god!|joey| yeah. we figured when we couldnt find you, youd gone home to make up with rachel. which is probably what you shoulda done. huh?
ross| you think?! god, i, ah, im in hell. i mean what, what am i gonna do? rachels all like, i love you and, and lets work on this. and all i can think about is, what is she gonna do? what is she gonna say? when i tell her what i did.|chandler| well, before we answer that, i think we should address the more important question. how dumb are you?
ross| what?! look, were trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. how am i supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?|joey| look, ross look, im on board about this totally honesty thing, i am, just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble.
chandler| hes right. nobodys gonna benefit, and youre just gonna hurt her.|joey| yeah, and there wont be a relationship left to rebuild.
ross| yeah, but dont you think....|chandler| all right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timings right. and thats what deathbeds are for.
ross| yeah, okay. |joey| all right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesnt find out some other way.  did you think about the trail?
ross| what trail?|joey|  you always have to think about the trail!
ross| oh, i-i dont think theres any trail.|chandler| okay, okay-okay, ah, chloe works with that guy issac. issacs sister is jasmine. and jasmine works at that message place with phoebe. and phoebes friends with rachel. and thats the trail, i did it!
phoebe|  after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg number one, |monica| did that!
phoebe| grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.|monica| okay.  ow!!!!! ow-oh-oh!
phoebe| was it not pain-free?|monica| no. it was painful. oh my god , they should call it pain-zine, now with a little wax.
phoebe| huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad.|monica| thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. but hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.
phoebe|  ow-ow-ow-ow! oh my god!!!|monica| now, are you glad we didnt start with the bikini strips?
ross|  chloe? hi.. |chloe| is this about me taking your watch?
ross| you took my watch?|chloe| im sorry, i do that.
ross| just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?|chloe| oh no. i feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know.
ross| exactly. so you didnt, didnt mention anything to issac right?|chloe| oh, well i tell issac everything.
ross| you tell, of course you do. issac. issac. hey, issac. issac, hi! y'know we havent actually met...|issac| you dog!
ross| yes, i suppose i am a dog. but issac, see i-i happen to have a girlfriend.|issac| oh right, that rachel chick from the coffee place.
ross| yeah, thats the one. listen, i dont want to hurt her.|issac| oh, hey, man i know, doesnt matter how much we love em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
ross| yeah. listen, can you keep this information to yourself?|issac| aw, no problem dude. y'know we got to look out for each other. were the same, you and me.
ross| actually, no, were not.|issac| yeah, we are.
ross| no, were not.|issac| yeah, we are.
ross| no, were not!!|issac| okay, were not.
ross| right.|issac| but, we are.

ross| we met at phoebes birthday party, im, im ross geller.|jasmine| you did a bad thing!
ross| yes, i did.|jasmine| very bad!
ross| very bad.|jasmine| very, very bad.
ross| im agreeing with you. did you, listen, did you happen to tell phoebe yet?|jasmine| no.
ross| okay, jasmine, please, please dont. i love my girlfriend very much, and i want more than anything to just work it out with her. okay?|jasmine| all right.
ross| thank you, thank you.|jasmine| but you should probably talk to my roommate, because i told him and he knows phoebe too.
ross|  whos your roommate?|ross| gunther! gunther. gunther, please tell me you didnt say anything to rachel about me and the girl from the xerox place.
gunther| im sorry. was i not supposed to?|monica| ow!

chandler| yeah, well i dont think you can make that statement, unless youve been kicked in an area that god only meant to be treated nicely.|joey| yeah, i-i think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, thats all. i mean, come on, its just a little wax.
phoebe| oh yeah, come here. |chandler| oh, thats mature.
joey| okay, fine, so now what, i just pull it off?|phoebe| uh-huh.

ross| listen. oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!|rachel| and yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! 
ross| look, i didnt think there was a relationship to jeopardise. i thought we were broken up. |rachel| we were on a break!
ross| that, for all i knew would, could last forever. that to me is a break-up.|rachel| you think youre gonna get out of this on a technicality?
ross| look, im not trying to get out of anything, okay. i thought our relationship was dead!|rachel| well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
joey| y'know what, i dont think we should listen to this anymore. |monica|  what, what are you doing? you cant go out there.
joey| why not?!  im hungry.|monica| because theyll know weve been listening.
rachel| god! and to have to hear about it from gunther!!|ross| come on! like i wanted him to tell you, i ran all over the place trying to make sure that didnt happen!
rachel| oh, that is so sweet. i think im falling in love with you all over again.|chandler| y'know what, i think we can go out there. i mean they have more important things to worry about.

phoebe| wait. why was he yelling at her? hes the one who slept with someone else. |joey| well, i guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
phoebe| whoa!! he is soo unreasonable! god, although i think i understand what he means. oh my god, this is like 60 minutes, okay, when, when, at first youre really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.|chandler| y'know what this is like? this is like when my parents got divorced. man, i hope ross doesnt try to kidnap me after cub scouts.
phoebe| y'know i had a dream where ross and rachel were still together, they never broke up. and we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....|joey| i had the same dream!
phoebe| yeah, and nobody slept with that xerox girl. |joey| oh, i had the opposite dream.

monica| what?!|pete| come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. cause you used to be like the chef, and i was the customer, and now were like this-this couple that fights.
monica| okay, umm, youre a loon.|pete| look, forget the check, okay.  i like you. i think youre great. come on, what do you say?

frank| umm, alice ah, she ah, called it off.|phoebe| oh no. did umm, did she say why?
frank| uh, no, not really, just that i was too young, y'know, but i dont see how i could all of the sudden be too young, cause im older than i was when we first got together.|phoebe| yeah, yeah, no, i dont, i dont know. but, y'know what, maybe its just all for the best?
frank| yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!|phoebe| oh, sweetie, oh. 
frank| y'know, i just was finally happy y'know. for the first time in my life! after my dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! i can, its still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with alice all that stuff kinda went away. and now its, and now its gone and i dont know why!|phoebe| uh, well i can tell you why. its, its because of me. but, y'know what, i only did it because i love you. okay?
frank| what?|phoebe| umm, well i, i kinda had a little chat with alice, and i sort of made her see why you two shouldnt be together, y'know. and youre gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
frank| wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?|phoebe| okay.
frank| well, you, wait no, my mother didnt want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch. |phoebe| okay, but.
frank| wait, y'know what, i-i came to you because i thought youd understand! oh no!! y'know, i would storm out of here right now if-if i had some money, or a place to go|rachel| oh my god! the millionaires here!

kate| and then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!|joey| and then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
kate| and then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....|joey| something like that?

chandler|  okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?|ross| well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
joey| well what is it?!|ross| he couldn't even tell me! he said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. and the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
chandler| y'know what? you should go to my guy, because when i went in there with my third nipple. he just lopped it right off. y'know? so i guess i'm lucky. i mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.|ross| at least they knew what yours was. y'know, yours had a name.

jason| whoa!|phoebe|  oh my god!!!
jason| ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!|phoebe|  no! no!

jason| w-w-w-wait! why?!|phoebe| well look, if i wanted to see a fireman, i would date one. okay?

monica|  y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe i won't water his plants.|chandler| well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe joey and i should water his plants. if y'know what i mean.
joey| or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.|phoebe|  and i-i can't take it! y'know? i'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. it's making me crazy.
rachel| well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?|phoebe|  uh.

chandler|  what if joey were president?|phoebe| umm, hey rach, can i ask you something?

pete| uh-oh.|monica| hey!  its me. mon-i-ca! can i just tell you how proud i am of you.
pete| it would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant you suck!|monica| i mean i-i thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. and now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
pete| what, look back?|monica| well, youre not gonna get going are you?
pete| well let me ask you a question. am i the ultimate fighting champion?|monica| well, no. but...
pete| well im not gonna stop until im the ultimate fighting champion.|monica| that guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
pete| let me tell you a story. when i set out to create moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? no. there was moss 1, that burnt down my dads garage, there was moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in january, and 862 others that i learned from, just like i learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.|monica| you didnt know that already?
pete| look, im gonna get better. okay? i promise you.|monica| okay, just get a lot better.  fast.
pete| oh, one other thing. hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.|monica| yeah. that-that was the problem.
monica|  hey.|ross| hey! how long until petes fight?
monica| oh, about five minutes. right now theyre interviewing his opponent. apparently he trains by going to iran and pulling the arms off thieves.|ross| hot dog?
monica| four, please. |phoebe| so ross, how umm, how did it go with bonnie?
ross| what? oh! i gotta tell you, i-i wasnt expecting to like her at all, i mean i actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific.|phoebe| ohh, thats too bad!
ross| no, i-im saying i liked her.|phoebe| yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
ross| pheebs, i think shes great. okay? were going out again.|phoebe| okay, i hear you! are you capable of talking about any thing else?
chandler|  hey! which ones my turkey burger?|ross| ahh, the one next to my foot. sorry.
joey|  hey, the fights starting!|ross| okay, well be right in.  so ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
chandler| nine times! okay, i had to put on lotion! but, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.|joey|  fights over!
chandler| excuse me, doug?  hey there sports fan!!|doug|  bing! you got those numbers for me?
chandler| no, i ah, i didnt do them.|doug| oh, you forgot?
chandler| no, no i just ah, didnt do them. instead, i ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so i certainly dont deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.|doug| well, i got tanked myself last night. pretty dicey drive home, tapanzi bridge never looked smaller.  bing!
chandler| doug!!|doug| hmm.
chandler| im a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.|doug| oh, is it the swearing? i mean is it the constant swearing? because i gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
chandler| no, no. it-its not about the swearing, its more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.|doug| oh?
chandler| oh, and dont get me wrong, i appreciate the sentiment. its just that i, i have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, its making all the other guys jealous.|doug| well, say no more. y'know it takes guts to bring this up. bing! youre okay.
chandler| okay. |doug| ha!  ahhhhhhh!
chandler| ahhhhh! |phoebe| okay. would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
rachel|  oh my god! phoebe look, its ross and that girl.|phoebe| no! no! look at that!  its a line of ants! theyre working as a team!
rachel| phoebe! |phoebe|  right, oh yeah. wow, oh, it looks like ross is breaking up with her. uff, i hope he lets her down easy. lets go.
rachel| come on phoebe, look at that! they are not breaking up, look at them. okay thats, you know what that is? that is a, that is a second date, thats what that is! look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...|phoebe| oh no! that really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
rachel| ohh!  phoebe, this is all your fault! now he loves her, hes gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.|phoebe| you said it was okay!
rachel| you said she was bald!!|phoebe| what?! what-what-what-what-what?!!
rachel| phoebe, we cant, we just cant just let it happen! okay, we have to do something! we have to break them up! okay? just go in there and like, shave her head! you owe me one bald girl!!|phoebe| okay, first of all, breathe. second of all, i dont get it. arent you the one that decided that you didnt want to be with ross?
rachel|  yes.|phoebe| well isnt he your friend? dont you want him to be happy?
rachel| yes.|phoebe| so?
rachel| i just y'know, i didnt expect him to be this happy so soon. ufff. ooo-ooh!  |phoebe|  oh no.
rachel| what?|phoebe| oh, we killed them all.
rachel| oh! |pete| its okay, its not as bad as it looks, its a precaution. ah, im not supposed to move my spine.
monica| please tell me youre stopping now.|pete| im fine! id fight tonight, if theyd let me.  see this circle im marking off here? this is my zone of terror.
monica| you are insane! you-you gotta give this up!|pete| i cant until im the ultimate fighter. i will do it. im telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or superman. now, im not saying i could beat superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
monica| sit down. all right? please, just listen to me. you are terrible at this! okay? you are the worst ultimate fighter ever! ever!! |pete| y'know i have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised adams apple, but that really hurt.
monica| well then, y'know what? i care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. so if you have to do this, then youre gonna have to do it without me.|pete| well if youre asking me to quit, then youre asking me to be someone im not. ive got to do this.
monica| then ive gotta go. bye. |pete| mon-monica?
monica| yes?|pete| could you leave a note? cause im on a lot of pain killers now, and i dont know if ill remember this tomorrow. 
doug| so, in conclusion, the lines all go up |chandler| thank you, sir.
stevens|  oh, excuse me. i forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.|doug| of course, you did. forgot something else too ya bastard!  well, what about you? youre not feeling left out or anything are ya?
chandler| no. no, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous.|doug| everybody else got one, and you want one too. dont you?
chandler| ye-ye-yeah, yes i do!|doug| now get on out of here, you!

rachel| oh, i cant watch this. |joey| check it out, hes winning!  petes winning!
monica| really?!|joey| no-o-o!!
tv announcer| uh-oh, bruiser has becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.|all| oh! oh! 
phoebe| wait, if thats his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?|ross| well, this is ironic. of your last two boyfriends, richard didnt want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now pete cant.
bonnie| all right, i was 15, it was my best friend, ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, i dont know, we were, we were making out.|chandler| tell it again.  seriously.
rachel|  i mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?|joey| yeah, sure. well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
monica| joey, she was listing the countries shes done it in.|joey| well, i think we all learned something.
phoebe|  thats my moms writing! look.|chandler|  me and frank and phoebe, graduation 1965.
phoebe| y'know what that means?|joey| that youre actually 50?
phoebe| no-no, thats not, thats not me phoebe, thats her pal phoebe. according to her high school yearbook, they were like b.f.f.  best friends forever.|all| oh!
rachel| that is so cool.|phoebe| i know! so this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my dad is. so i looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. so maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
all| yeah! yeah, we can!|bonnie|  shoot! i cant go, i have to work!
ross| thats too bad.|rachel|  ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
phoebe| so great! okay! tomorrow were gonna drive out to montauk.|joey| hey, bonnie had sex there!
monica|  would you look at them. am i ever gonna find a boyfriend again? i gonna die an old maid.|chandler| youre not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
monica|  thanks!|chandler| hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, ill be your boyfriend.
monica| yeah right.|chandler| why is that so funny?
monica| you made a joke right? so i laughed.|chandler| ha-ha-ha. a little to hard. what am i not ah, boyfriend material?
monica| well, no. youre chandler. y'know, chandler! |chandler| okay, so weve established my name, and hit me. but theoretically y'know, i mean say we werent friends, say its a blind date. i show up at your door, and im like  hey, nice to meet, ya. hey, oh-hey.

phoebe| no, no-no, she was a human lady. this is the spirit of my mom lily, the one who killed herself.|ross| are you sure shes in the cat, or have you been taking your grandmas glycoma medicine again?

rachel| monica! i couldnt find him for two hours! he was having sex with amy welch!|monica| come on, that was back in high school! how could that still bother you?
rachel| i mean why, of all people would you want to go out with chip?!|monica| look, you and i went to different high schools...
rachel| okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school.|monica| you went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. i went to one where i wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
rachel|  they had to have that specially made?!|monica| it was a project for one of the home ec classes.
rachel|  oh my god, they told us that was for the mascot!|monica| back then, i thought that i would never, ever get the chance to go out with a chip matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out. and the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. i-i owe her this. i never let her eat.
rachel| oh, you go out with him.  |monica| oh, really?!
rachel| yeah. just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?|monica| ill try.
ross| so you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?|joey| well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, i dont think any of them are gonna work out.
chandler| yes, joey has a very careful screening process. apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.|phoebe|  stop it! stop it! she keeps squirming, trying to get away! just like when she was alive.
ross| so pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?|phoebe| well, im not sure. i mean, i guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that theres y'know, a new mom. y'know, i think shes worried that y'know, shes gonna, shes gonna be replaced.  okay, i have to return a call in the other room.
monica| why cant you use the phone in here?|phoebe| well, im returning a call from a certain mom at the b-e-a-c-h. i just spelled the wrong word. 
ross| so, guys, am i crazy, or does phoebes mom remind anyone of a cat?|monica| ross, dont start.
ross| come on, you-you cant tell me you actually believe that-that theres a woman inside that cat!|rachel| i believe it.
ross| no you dont. |rachel| yes, i do.
ross| no you doy'know what, youre not gonna suck me into this.|rachel| oh sure i am, because you always have to be right.
ross| i do not always have to beokay, okay. |rachel| jurassic park could happen.
tony| wow! thats ah, thats pretty nice!|joey| pretty nice?
chandler| youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.|tony| we dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? weve got a canoe.

mrs. geller| hmm.|monica| why did you hire me?
mrs. geller| oh, well richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. then i heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, i assume you werent sleeping with anybody there. though, at least that would be something. |monica|  oh my god! did you hear that? she hired me because she thinks im good.
phoebe| okay, i didnt hear that.|monica| oh yeah, she didnt hire me out of pity, it wasnt so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks im good.

mrs. geller| oh no, dont be silly. i just bet id need these. |monica| frozen lasagnas?
mrs. geller| um-hmm.|monica| you bet that id screw up?! so all that stuff about hiring me because i was good was

kathy| not your type?! she's gorgeous!|chandler| y'know what i think it is? it's the fishnet stockings. y'know? whenever i see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
kathy| okay. understanding a little more why you're single. ohh! y'know, i have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. and then we could double date!|chandler| uhh, no-no thanks.
kathy| okay, i've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.|chandler| listen, i-i'm gonna grab a beer. 
joey|  what was that?|chandler| what?
joey| kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. i thought we had a deal.|chandler| hey, look, what do you want from me?
joey| i want you to like her! but if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.|chandler| i am pretending.
joey| well then, do it better!|chandler| okay, what do you saw i go over there and say how much i like her?  no-no it'll be good, i can tell her much i've been thinking about her. that i haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment i met her. that i'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day i can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
joey| well, that's pretty good. but you might wanna tone it down a little.|ross|  so uhh, i guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
monica| no, sorry.|rachel| well where's amanda?
monica| hey rach, could you get me some cough drops?|rachel| i mean y'know, i'm thinking. you could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
monica| ross, cough drops, please?|ross| at least i know she's not going out with me to get into r rated movies.
rachel| why don't you just marry her? oh no, wait a minute you can't, i'm sorry i forgot, she's not a lesbian.|ross| you see amanda and i have a very special...
monica|  you have nothing! you're not even going out! you're her baby sitter! you have a 12-year-old girl's job!|rachel|  ohh, that is soo sad.
monica| and what are you laughing at, miss `my-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'|rachel| hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! at least he bought me something with it! 
monica| that's mine!! now, would you both please start acting like adults? and get me my cough drops!|ross| fine.

ross| actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era. |chandler| okay, but that's, like, the easiest era. 
ross| i've seen her at work, but i always figured, ah-huh? but, uh, i made her dinner. we had a great time. and we're going out again tomorrow. |rachel| well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.

rachel| oh, the velveteen rabbit! oh my god, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real! |chandler| okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils. 
rachel| huh. well, then you'd better keep it away from ross's hair. so this is pretty rare. how did you get that? |chandler| oh, it wasn't a big deal. i just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren. 
rachel| oh, honey, that's so sweet. |phoebe| yeah, and what a great way to say, \i secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!\ 
chandler| it doesn't say that. does it? |ross| how do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend joey gives her an orange? 
chandler| okay, all right, i'll just uh, make sure that uh, joey gets her something really great. |phoebe| it's gotta be better than that book. oo! like a crossbow! 
monica|  i just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people. |rachel| oh my god! what happened? 
monica| sixty guests. |ross| so, uh, why did you have to turn it down? 
monica| because i don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. i mean there's no way. |phoebe| wow, what is with all the negativity? you sound like monican't , not monican...  ...monica. look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. do you want to be a caterer or not? 
monica| i don't know. |phoebe| there you go, that's the spirit! okay! now, if you need money, i will lend you money, but just get moving! 
monica| really? cause i'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff. |phoebe| okay! it's worth it, if it will get you moving. you haven't worked in months. 
monica| well, you're not working either. |phoebe| yes, but i'm doing this. 
monica| yeah, that'd be great! thank you! |joey| hey! 
everyone| hey. |kathy| can i borrow the keys to your apartment? 
joey| why? |joey| you can pee here! 
kathy| ahahaha... haha.. yes i can, of course. excuse me. |chandler| it's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway.  hey joe! what are you getting kathy for her birthday? 
joey| we've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think i gotta get her something? |everyone| yeah! 
rachel| yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice. |joey| oh, i know... 
rachel| and not one of your coupons for an hour of \joey love.\ |phoebe| ooo, a crossword! can i help? 
rachel| no! i'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week i got all but three answers and i really want to finish a whole one without any help. |phoebe| fine. but you can't help me develop my new universal language. 
monica| hey! |rachel| hey, how'd it go? 
monica| oh my god, it was the best funeral ever! i mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? i even got another funeral for tomorrowthe dead-guy-from-today's best friend. i mean, it is like i am the official caterer for that accident! |phoebe| mon! i'm so happy for you! 
monica| thanks. like, check out my new catering stuff.  look at this! i'm an omelet station! omelet? made to order! |phoebe| i'll have one, please. plus my money. 
monica| oh. well, i didn't realize that you needed it back right away. i mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. so i went. i beed. i mean, i... i used it to buy all this stuff. but looki've got another job tomorrow, so i'll pay you back with the money i make from that. |phoebe| oh. okay. oo, sorry i acted like a bank. 
monica| okay. |ross|  huh... 
cheryl| um, would you like to come in? |ross| did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools? 
cheryl| according to recent findings! |cheryl|  here mitzi! here mitzi! 
ross| mitzi is..... |cheryl| my hamster. i hope she's okay, i haven't seen her in a while. have a seat. 
ross|  ...do you have any, um, cinnamon fruit toasties? |cheryl| what? 
ross| well, i do! why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of cinnamon fruit toasties, uh... |cheryl| i'd rather not. 
ross| oh, yeah, why not? |cheryl| okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell. 
monica| oh, is everything in the car? |phoebe| yes. did you settle the bill? 
monica| no. i hate this part. |phoebe| oh, look what we almost left.  
monica| no, that's not mine. |phoebe| oh, all right. oh! look what we almost took! 
monica| excuse me, mrs. burkart? well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen. |mrs. burkart| oh, good. thank you. 
monica| um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of... |mrs. burkart| dear? 
monica| just the matter of ...payment? |mrs. burkart|  
rachel| you know what we should all do? go see a musical. |chandler|  sure... 
rachel| and you know which one we should see? the 1996 tony award winner. do you happen to know the name of that one? |chandler| i don't know... um, grease? 
rachel| no.... |chandler| rent? 
rachel| yes! rent! |chandler| okay, so when do you want to go? 
rachel| what? oh, i'm sorry, i can't, i'm busy. |joey|  hey. man, it is so hard to shop for girls. 
chandler| yes, it is, at office max. |rachel| what did you get her?  
chandler| a pen.|joey| it's two gifts in one. it's a pen that's also a clock! huh? 
chandler| huh-huh! you can't give her that. |joey| why not? 
chandler| because she's not eleven! and it's not the seventh night of hanukkah! |rachel| okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives? 
joey| sure it is! she needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... \whoa! it's time for my date with joey!\ |chandler| all right, look, look. what did... what did you get for angela delveccio for her birthday? 
joey| she didn't have a birthday while we were going out. |chandler| for three years? 
joey|  look, it's too late, and i got an audition. i can't shop anymore! i... |chandler| all right. i will go out and i will try to find something for her, okay? 
joey| thanks, man. and oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card? |chandler| would you like me to write her a little poem as well? 
joey| or... just get a card that has a poem already in it. |phoebe| but mon, you have to get our money! 
monica| oh, phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! with those thick glasses, her tears looked giant. |phoebe| i know, it's tough. you know what the first thing i did after my mother's funeral was? 
monica| what? |phoebe| pay the caterer! look, i've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. it's either, you know, \that massage wasn't long enough, or, \i don't recognize any of those songs,\ or, you know, \these sombreros aren't big enough. bad little white girl!\ 
monica| okay. so what do you.... you think she's faking? |phoebe| well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill. 
monica| phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me. |mrs. burkart|  you're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave.... 
phoebe| she seems fine now. |mrs. burkart|  ...emblem of the land i love. the home of.... 
joey| so, you just left? her place was really that bad? |ross| you know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day? 
joey| yeah. |ross| well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. and instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. and instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!  here. 
joey| wow. thanks. so, uh, what happened? |ross| what do you mean? nothing happened! i had to get out of there. 
joey| all right, so... next time, you take her to your place. |ross| no, i tried that. she says it has a weird smell. 
joey| what kind of smell? |ross| i don't know. soap? 
joey| all right, listen, ross... you like this girl, right? |ross| yeah. 
joey| you wanna see her again, right? |ross| yeah. 
joey| so you're gonna have to do it in the mess! |ross| yeah, okay you're right. 
joey| yeah. |ross| i mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness? 
joey| yeah! |ross| it's, uh... it's endearing, really. 
joey| all right! now you go get that beautiful pig!  oink! |chandler| okay, all right. i just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for kathy that would be better than the rabbit. 
rachel| any luck? |chandler| oh, yeah. yeah, i found this great place called \invisible things for kathy.\  can you give me a hand with all this stuff? 
rachel| all right, look. why don't you just return the book, let joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. like... a regular pen. |chandler| she's really going to love this, you know? the bottom line is i want her to have it, even if i don't get to be the one who gives it to her. 
rachel| aw, honey, that's so sweet. |chandler| yeah? you don't think it's just pathetic? 
rachel| oh! pathetic!  |joey|  hey! i'm meeting kathy in ten minutes! i've been looking all over for you! 
chandler| where? |joey| our place, the hall! i... 
chandler| i got something for her.  it's a book! |joey|  is it like a book that's also a safe? 
chandler| no, it's a book that's just a book, okay? it's an early edition of the velveteen rabbit. it was her favorite book as a kid. so, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay? |joey| you got it. thanks man. thanks for doing this, i owe you one.  oh, hey! there wasn't any change from that twenty, was there? 
chandler| no, it came out to an even twenty. |joey| wow. that's almost as much as a new book. 
mrs. burkart|  jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes? |phoebe| you didn't get the money, did you? 
monica| maybe i can try at intermission? phoebe, come on... you know what? let's just go! |phoebe| no! hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! i don't know who she thinks she is! enough is enough!  hey, widow? 
mrs. burkart|  come on along and listen to... |phoebe| okay, widow! 
mrs. burkart|  ...the lullabye of... |phoebe| excuse me. excuse me!  thanks. um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny.

chandler| no! no! no! i just kissed her.|joey| what?!! thats even worse!!
chandler| how is that worse?!|joey| i dont know! but its the same!
chandler| look, im sorry! but theres nothing i can do, i think im in love with her!|joey| who cares?! you went behind my back! i would never do that to you!
chandler| youre right, i have no excuses! i was totally over the line.|joey| over the line?! you-youre-youre so far past the line, that you-you cant even see the line! the line is a dot to you!
chandler| yes. yes! right! and i feel horrible. you have to believe me!|joey| is that why you bought all this stuff?!  well, yknow what i will not watch your tv, i will not listen to your stereo, and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that im not gonna eat! you know why?!
chandler| probably because|joey| because its all tainted with your betrayal. from now on this apartment is empty for me! and im not happy about you either. 
phoebe| oh my god, hes lost it. hes totally lost it.|monica|  what?
rachel| phoebe, his music could not get any worse. there are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.|ross| thank you, thanks.  would you, can you finish my set?
phoebe| after that? yeah! no, i mean if i can help.|ross| yeah, like i could lose it.
rachel| what?|ross| i played bad on purpose guys.
monica| okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.|ross| yeahno, just that last song.

rachel| so are things with you and joey any better?|chandler| they couldnt be worse. i spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
rachel| oh wow, eight hours? so you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?|ross| should we all expect christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
rachel| you shouldnt.|phoebe| speaking of christmas, umm since monica and i are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret santa, and then we each only buy one gift. and-and theres the added mystery of who gets who.
ross| who gets whom.  i dont know why i do that.|rachel| well, im gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
monica| we havent eaten yet!|rachel| i know, but all that work youre doing to get it ready, i just 
chandler| hey, by any chance did either of pick uh rachel for your secret santa, cause i wanna trade for her.|phoebe| i picked her! oh thank god you want her! ooh!
chandler| wow! why do you want to get rid of her so badly?|phoebe| because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, its like impossible to get her something she likes. come on, lets trade!
chandler| oh thats not true! thats not true! i got her that backpack and she loved it! i remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it  her initials|phoebe| ohh.
monica| well, maybe you could give to somebody else. ooh, like ross geller.|chandler| op, y'know what though, its kindve a girlie briefcase.
monica| who cares? he works in a museum!|chandler| hey, what time is it? the big game is about to start!
phoebe| you dont have to do that, ross and joey arent here, you can watch the parade if you want.|chandler| thanks.
monica| what is wrong with this freezer?!  ow! ow!!|phoebe| god, what happened?!
monica| oh my god, ice just got in my eye!|rachel|  people are trying to sleep in here!
chandler| monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.|phoebe| open it up, let me see.
monica| oh, yknow what, i cant, it really kills.|chandler| well maybe you should put some ice on it.
phoebe| ooh, god it looks bad.|rachel| honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
monica| no, my eye doctor is richard! i cant go to him when i dont have a boyfriend!|chandler| hes really picky about his patients.
phoebe| honey, youve got to go. whats his office number?|monica| like i remember his office number!  speed dial 7.
phoebe|  hes out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?|monica| yes!!
phoebe| yes! shes very excited about that.|phoebe| this is so cool, til monica gets back, its like im head chef and i get to make all the decisions. 
ross| hey-hey, i thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!|phoebe| okay, get out of my kitchen!
chandler|  i mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.|phoebe| all right i i gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
ross| so listen ah, i picked monica for secret santa, but im already getting her something for chanukah, i was wondering if you wanna switch.|chandler| oh yknow what, i was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
ross| really?! wow! thats-thats so nice, what are you gonna get me?|chandler| i dont know r.g., i was thinking something girlie for your office.
ross| yeah, well maybe phoebe will switch with me.|chandler| oh no-no-no, you dont want to do that, then youre gonna get stuck with rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
ross| oh, thats not true! ive got her lots of stuff she never took back.|chandler| like?
ross| like uh, that gold necklace i got her last year.|chandler| when was the last time you saw her wear it?
ross| well, she wore it all christmas day, and then uh|chandler| big dog?
ross|  hey!|joey| hey!
ross| what are you doing?|joey| im sending back all this stuff that chandler bought out of guilt.
ross| everything? even the tv?|joey| no! im putting that in my room.
ross| listen, joey, i know what he did was wrong but dont you think you could at least hear the guy out?|joey| back when you and rachel were together, if chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
ross| thats a good point. so uh, how long are you gonna punish him?|joey| five years. 
ross| youve sentenced him?!|joey| hey! dont do the crime if you cant do the time.
ross| joey, the guys your best friend.|joey| no, was my best friend. anyway, i dont know why youre pushing for him so hard. with him out of the way as my best friend, theres a spot open.
ross| oh, who? me?|joey| yeah!
ross| wow! im honored! and yknow what im gonna do as my first act as your best friend?|joey| what?
ross| im gonna get you to talk to chandler.|joey| all right. but if you werent my best friend.
kathy| oh my god, is it really that bad?|chandler| i walk into a room and he wont even talk to me, he just mumbles something in italian. and i know he only knows the bad words.
joey|  hey gunther, have you uh, have you seen chandler?|gunther| i thought you were chandler. but umm, one of who is over there.

chandler| hey! im sorry! that where are you going?|joey| my folks.
chandler| oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?|joey| i dont know. i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment.
chandler| what?!|joey| yeah, yknow at first i thought we could talk about this yknow, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together i dont think i
chandler| hey, look, what do you want me to say? do you want me to say that ill stop seeing her?|joey| look, its not about her. okay? but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. and i dont want to live with some one who doesnt know what it is to be a friend. so, ill see ya. 
chandler| hey, look, i know what it is to be a friend, i just-i just screwed up!|joey| yeah! you did! and thats why im leaving.
chandler| all right look, if youre not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! okay, they have had a very difficult year! what with the robbery and all!|joey| when that guy was robbing us, and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what i was doing in there all that time? i was thinking about how i let you down! 
chandler| what?|joey| yeah! but if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, i wouldnt have worried about it so much! see you around!
chandler| all right, wait! come on! just wait one second! there has to be something that i can do! something! if we still had that entertainment unit i would get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down.  what?|joey| weve got a box. 
tim| last time i saw you, it was the morning i left for college. and you were just standing outside the dairy queen.|monica| i was probably waiting for it to open.
tim| i gotta tell you, you look great now.|monica| you look great too.
tim| youre an excellent patient!|monica| so how does it look?
tim| well, youve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.|monica| like a pirate?!
tim| if that helps you. |monica| umm, so how long have you been working with your dad?  come on, one of us had to mention him.
tim| i moved back here a couple of months ago.|monica| oh. big family dinner tonight?
tim| uh. |monica| no way!
tim| i was gonna have thanksgiving at my girlfriends.|monica|  oh.
tim| but we broke up.|monica|  oh.

tim| youre not wearing the patch yet.|monica| i know.
ross| hes coming here for thanksgiving!|rachel| i know, its sick.
monica| why is it sick?|rachel| because its richards son! its like inviting greek tragedy over for dinner!
monica| hey, come on, phoebe, you understand dont you?|phoebe| yeah, i can see where id be your best shot but, no. im sorry, but i think its twisted.
ross| yeah.|joey|  whats twisted?
monica| me going out with richards son.|joey| ewwwww!! ew! ew! ew!
chandler|  sounds like a really bad idea to me.|rachel| is he okay in there?
joey| hes fine!|ross| hey, y'know, mon, if things wrong out between you and richards son, youd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
monica| fine! judge all you want to but, |rachel| so now, what exactly is the point of the box?
joey| chandler?|chandler| the meaning of the box is three fold. one , it hurts!
ross|  oh hey! hey uh, you remember the necklace i gave you last year? can i see it?|rachel|  why?
ross| i just wanna check something.|rachel| okay. 
ross|  now, well see.|chandler| air hole! air hole!! 
rachel|  here it is! i love it. i wear it all the time.|ross|  the necklace i got you was gold, this one is silver.
rachel| huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. |ross| oh my god! you actually exchanged it!
rachel| well isnt it better that i exchanged it for something that i enjoy and that i can get a lot of use out of?|ross| what did you get?

monica| i saved you a seat. |rachel|  sick-sick-sick-sick.
phoebe| oh, ill get it. |chandler| gotcha! 
joey| that doesnt sound like thinking to me!|chandler| sorry!
joey| yknow i dont think you should be talking at all in there! i think youve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!|chandler| okay, okay, you got it!
rachel| ross, can you pass me the yams?|ross| sure! oh, and joeys got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
rachel| would you stop?! what is the matter with you?!|monica| oh-ho-ho, weve got company.
ross| theres nothing the matter with me. see, im not completely devoid of sentiment, see i have feelings.|rachel| okay, fine. 
chandler| you cant tell, but im trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!|joey| all right, look! if this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! this means something to me! and if it doesnt mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise youre just an idiot in a box!
chandler| youre right, and im sorry! this means a lot to me! i want you to be my friend again! i swear, i wont say another word tonight.|joey| so are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
chandler| absolutely!|joey| that sounds like another word to me! are you gonna take this seriously?  okay.
rachel| dont say that i have no sentiment!  this is from the museum from the first time we were together. okay, maybe i exchange gifts sometimes, but i keep the things that matter! |ross| i dont know what to say, im sorry. though, youre not supposed to take these.  its like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
monica| |tim| here, let me help. 
monica| thank you.|tim| you-you have a very beautiful eye.
monica| yknow all my friends think this is weird. |tim| yknow i-i thought it was gonna be weird, i mean i almost called and canceled, but it really isnt.

joey| no, i had sex in high school.|rachel| oh, uh, joanna i was wondering if i could ask you something. theres an opening for an assistant buyer in junior miss
joanna|  okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.|rachel| well, actually, i meant for me. the hiring committee is meeting people all day and
joanna| oh. well, i wish i could say no, but you cant stay my assistant forever. neither can you sophie, but for different reasons.|rachel| god, i am so glad you dont have a problem with this, because if you did, i wouldnt even consider applying.
joanna| really? well, in that case|rachel|  and thats im so glad theres no problem.
joanna| thats fine, actually im on the hiring committee, so therell be at least one friendly face.|rachel| ohh! thats great!
joanna| you know, junior miss is where i started. oh, i had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.|rachel| really?!
joanna| no-ho-ho!  i mean, no-no-no-no-no, dont you worry, im sure with your qualifications you wont need to sleep with some guy to get that job. although, i might need some convincing.|rachel| well, i, umm

joey| will you calm down, hes just a human guy.|chandler| look you dont understand, gandolf is amazing. yknow youre never know whats gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to nova scotia! 
joey| really?!|chandler| oh yeah, its beautiful country up there.
ross|  hey! okay! i got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!|chandler| its not gonna be exactly like last time.

chandler| hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in chicago.|ross| ohh, man! chicago, is sooo lucky!
chandler| stupid, useless canadian money!|mr. posner| you have a very impressive resume, ms. green. i especially like what i see here about implementing a new filing system.
rachel| thank you.|joanna| filing system? oh-oh! you mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?  it certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets. 
rachel| well, they uh, they-they do more than that.|mrs. lynch| i notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
rachel| yes, joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.|joanna| oh. and rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. its amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
rachel| i-i-i of course, i have more responsibilities than that.|joanna| oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  rachel can carry two things at once!
mr. posner| yes, thats very good. now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.|rachel| yes, i realize that
joanna|  and rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. the only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what i mean.|rachel| i love working with designers!
joanna| with them, under them, whats the difference? eh, rach?|monica| hey! my first review is out!
phoebe| ohh! oh, the chelsea reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.|monica| all right, look at my on the back page.

allesandro| well, you said that we except the discover card, which we do not!|monica| all right, that ill retract. but i stand by my review, i know food and that wasnt it. youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! you should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.

joanna| sophie, get in here!  you see! now youre making sophie uncomfortable!|sophie| shes not making me uncomfortable.
joanna| congratulations! you now just crossed the line into completely useless. get out. |rachel| do you want me to quit?
joanna| what?! what would make you think that?|rachel| well of those things that you said in the interview, i mean if you believe any of them, i must not be a very good assistant. yknow what? i am just gonna pack up my desk, 
joanna| wait-wait-wait-wait! you can put your sad little muffin back in its drawer. if you must know the truth, i didnt want to lose a perfectly good assistant.|rachel| what?
joanna| thats why i said all those things about your flirting and your drinking|rachel| my drinking? 
joanna| oh, i mustve said that after you left.|rachel| said what? exactly.
joanna| that you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge.|rachel| oh my god!! ohh, that is it! im leaving! you are just a horrible person!
joanna| wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! if youre gonna get all sensitive about it! i dont want to lose you. what if i, create a position for you? ill make you an assistant buyer in this department.|rachel| say more things like that.

chandler| oh-no, yknow with gandolf wed be out all night!|ross| yeah! wed meet, wed meet total strangers, and hang out with them!

joey and ross| yeah!!!|chandler| all right!!
ross|  hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?|chandler| remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
ross| yeah.|chandler| well, those were seals, man.
rachel| hey mon, little question for ya! how do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?|monica| okay, the owner of allesandros came over to yell at me, but instead i made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
rachel| oh my god!! you just ruined the thing i was practicing the whole way home, but im soo happy!|monica| can you believe it? i finally get to run my own kitchen!
rachel| ohh, youve waited soo long. |phoebe|  hey!
rachel| hey, pheebs, quick question for ya.|phoebe| yeah.
rachel| how do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at bloomingdales?|phoebe| i dont know, it would totally depend on her coloring and  you got the job!!
rachel| yes!!!|monica| you got the job?! why didnt you tell me?
rachel| ohh, its gonna be so great! im gonna get to help decide what we sell, im gonna have an office with walls and everything.  im gonna have walls!|phoebe| okay, is this the day of good news or what? i got us a job! the wedding reception.

monica| i know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like its snowballing, yknow?|phoebe| yeah! what are you saying?
monica| i got offered the head chef job at allesandros.|phoebe| what?
monica| its okay, cause y'know what? you dont really need me for the business.|phoebe| youre the cook! with out you its just me driving up to peoples houses with empty trays and asking for money!

chandler| hey, you know what you can do? i remember reading about this director, i think it was orson wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. then they would all know, whos boss.|joey| hey, mon! im not doing anything, why dont you fire me?

rachel| well, how can you be a tour guide, dont you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?|joey| no, not really. they give you all the information, its uh, its like memorizing a script.  \and on your left, you have tyrannosaurus rex, a carnivore from the jurassic period.

phoebe| i know!|ross| pheebs, youre talking about putting your body through an awful lot, i mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and its all for somebody else!
phoebe| yeah, whats your point?|ross| well, the stuff i just mentioned.

joey| no, pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive like crazy.|all| yeah.

ross| that is really nicelying! no way is that the reason!|rachel| why? just because youre not mature enough to understand something like that?!
chandler| no, hes right, im totally lying.|monica| then what is it?
chandler| well, kathys last boyfriend was joey.|ross| and youre afraid you wont be able tofill his shoes.
chandler| no, im afraid i wont be able to make love as well as him.|ross| yeah, i was going for the metaphor.
chandler| yes, and i was saying the actual words.|monica| so big deal, so joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.
chandler| we share a wall! so either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.|monica| sweetie, with you its gonna be different. the sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.
chandler| yeah?|rachel| yeah!
ross| just go for it chandler.|monica| yeah, you should.

phoebe sr| oh, thats okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.|phoebe| wow! you really go all out when youre expecting company.
phoebe sr| no, i was working on my pottery.|phoebe| oh! ooh! oh, i didnt know that you didpot.
phoebe sr| well, yeah, mostly nudes. it combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.|phoebe| ooh, erotiery!
phoebe sr| hey! okay! well thanks for coming out to see me. i just-i just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. yknow|phoebe| okay.
phoebe sr| i really dont think its a very good idea, phoebe.|phoebe| why not?
phoebe sr| well, because youd be giving up a baby, and i-i really donti dont know if theres anything i can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. so, umm, |phoebe| oh no! no-no! i understand the pain! dont-dont hurt the puppy.
phoebe sr| no-no-no, the-the puppys yours.|phoebe| oh, i get a puppy!!
phoebe sr| well, yeah! i mean yeah, but only for three days.|phoebe| why?
phoebe sr| i realise i dont have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm,  uhh phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, its very important. |phoebe| okay.
phoebe sr| i mean, i know what im talking about. i gave up two babies, and i only wish i had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. i just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. so, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child.  i really shouldnt have given you the puppy first.|phoebe| all right, im sorry.
joey| uhh, do you mind sitting there. im-im saving this for my friend ross.|tour guide| you mean dr. geller?
joey| doctor? wow! i didnt know he had a nickname.|tour guide| oh, he wont sit here. only the people in the white coats sit over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
joey| well, how-how come?|tour guide| thats just the way it is.
joey| thats crazy.|tour guide| maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. see that scientist in the classes, he and i used to play together all the time in grade school, but now see, he pretend he dont even here me!
joey| i-i think everybodys pretending they dont hear you. anyway, look, i dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but ross is one of my best friends, and if i save him a seat, im telling you, he will sit in it!  ross! ross! over here, man! i-i saved you seat.|ross| thats okay, im cool over here. ill catch up with you later, joey. 
tour guide| op, this is saved.  gift shop.|ross|  hey, uh, im really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
joey| its no big deal. hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do. right?|ross| but hey, its not just me, i mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.

ross| hey!|phoebe| hey!
joey| hey!|phoebe| ooh! how was kathys play?
ross| well, kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin guy.|chandler| yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
phoebe| thats a good idea for a business!|chandler| im totally screwed. okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes gonna try to undermine me. y'know itll be like, \so wheres your boyfriend, whats-his-name, chester?\ and shell go, \no-no-no, its chandler.\ and hell go, \whatever. ha-ha-ha-ha!\
joey|  that-that is a good trick.|chandler| all right, look, look, what am i gonna do?
joey| chandler, look theyre actors. theyre there to do a job, just cause they work together, doesnt mean theyre gonna get together. i mean just cause it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins, it doesnt mean its gonna happen with them.|ross| oh-oh, alec baldwin and kim basinger.
joey| tom cruise and nicole kidman. |ross| yeah.
phoebe| hey, mel gibson and clint eastwood.|ross| theyre not a couple!
phoebe| oh-okay, i get the game now.|joey| okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
ross| oh yeah!|joey| well okay, so then youre fine. the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. okay? so as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.
chandler| really?|joey| look, you guys have been to every play ive ever been in, have i ever had chemistry on stage?
ross| no.|joey| noooo!!
chandler| so uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?|ross| yknow what, i dont know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.

rachel| okay.|mr. waltham| rachel, you needed to speak to me?
rachel| no-no, that wasnt me!  the selection of underwear we carry.|rachel| oh-oh, sorry, its this way, its this way. 
joshua| its this way? sorry. |chandler| im right! right? there was like no chemistry between them. before they had heat, and now theres no heat! now you know what this means, joey told us what this means!
ross| all right, lets not jump to any conclusions. all right? there was some sexual chemistry between them.|chandler| come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
ross| here she comes. dont say a word, okay? just be cool, dont bey'know you.|kathy| hey you guys!
ross| hey!|kathy| hi!  thank you so much for coming again. did you like it tonight?
ross| oh, absolutely! |kathy| wasnt nick funny when he couldnt get his match lit?
kathy| its a good play, isnt it?|chandler| oh, i loved the play. you were great, and nick ditto. clearly youre having sex with him.
ross| okay, i |kathy| clearly, im having sex with him?
chandler| oh come on, it was so obvious! there was no chemistry between you two!|kathy| okay, so let me just get this straight. youre accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
chandler| yknow, i-i could see how this could happen, y'know youre up there every night, youre naked, touching, kissing.|kathy| acting! chandler, this is my job! im-im playing a part in a play! how can you not trust me?!
chandler| well, you can understand, given how we started.|kathy| oh, wow. i cant believe youre throwing that in my face.

emily| we dont have to.|ross| whoa-whoa-what? you found a place?
emily| no. but, monica and i were talking, and-and i was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.|ross| she said what?
emily| she said, \if im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.\|ross| postpone it? emily, do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?  this isnt right.
emily| i realize that people are going to be disappointed. but, im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.|ross| i cant ask people to do that? would you ask people to do that? 
emily| dont you point your pants at me!  we have no choice! anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, ross dont you understand? this is our wedding im talking about.|ross| the only thing i understand is; postponing it is not an option. this is when were getting married.
emily| so what are you saying? its now or never?|ross| no. im saying its now. 
emily| or?|ross| theres no or in mind. what is wrong with these pants?!!
emily| its not the pants. its you that is backwards. and if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all! |ross| 
phoebe| hey!|rachel|  hi.
phoebe| so, did shopping make you feel any better about ross?|rachel| manhattan does not have enough stores.
phoebe| well, i think i can help you get over him.|rachel| you can?

phoebe| and a small piece of chocolate.|rachel| okay.
phoebe| and a glass of tepid water. |rachel| ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
phoebe| uh, only if you have the hiccups too. yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. i just didnt feel like getting up. okay, im gonna show you a picture of ross. okay? and youre going to remember all of the bad things about him. all right? really focus on his flaws.|rachel| i can do that. i certainly did it when we were going out.
phoebe| okay. umm, before we get started, i just wanna say for the record that i love ross, i think hes such a great guy. here.  okay, now, close your eyes. and imagine that youre with ross okay and imagine that youre kissing him. and youre-youre running your hands all over his body. and then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross its some kind of grease, itsuck! hah?|rachel| i dont know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and yknow it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
phoebe| okay, this is going to be harder than i thought. umm, lets try some uh, aversion therapy.|rachel| okay.
phoebe| okay?|rachel| all right.
phoebe| so uh, now look at the picture|rachel| okay.

ross| yeah.|monica| why?!
ross| i dont know, i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.|monica| oh my god. youre even dumber than i am!
ross| excuse me?|monica| ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
ross| i dont know. a month?|monica| emily has probably been planning it since she was five! ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. thats what we did! we dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake  thanks. but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
ross| i had no idea. and that-that pillowcase thing, i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.|monica| sometimes we were.
ross| come on. you gotta help me figure out what to do. okay?|monica| okay.
ross| come on. |chandler| that was pretty intense huh?
joey| yeah.  hey, i hope ross didnt think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!|chandler|  i hope he did!
phoebe| hello.|joey|  hey, pheebs! its joey!
phoebe| hey, joey! hey! ooh! ooh! i just say someone on thethat looks just like you on the subway. and i was gonna go over and say hi! but then i figured, he doesnt care if he looks like you.|joey| that just cost me four bucks. but uh listen, i just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?

phoebe| oh, do you need a hug? you don't have to bring me anything!|joey| come on! do something!
chandler| i am, i'm ignoring you.|joey| okay, here! 
chandler| oh, what the hell is that?|joey| it's london, baby! all right, the hotel's here. 
chandler| okay, if you see a little version of me in there? kill it!|joey| i got it!  here we go.
chandler| okay. listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?|joey| shhh! 
emily| ...and that was all before 10 o'clock. the caterer rang and said it was going to be chicken kiev instead of chicken tarragon. and then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. we're not gonna be...|ross| whoa-whoa-whoa! emily,  honey, okay?
emily| well, up yours too!|ross| what?! 
emily| oh, that's not what it means?|ross| no! no! that's-that's time-out!
emily| sorry.|ross| sweetie, you gotta relax. everything's gonna be great, okay? come on. come on.
monica| chicken kiev?|ross| um-hmm! doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
monica| yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. and, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella.  but of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... so, i can't wait to see this place you're getting married!|ross| yeah. yeah. yes, this place is beautiful. emily's parents got married here.
emily| i still can't believe they're tearing it down. it really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. i mean it's over...  oh my god!|monica| it's nice.
emily| oh. oh. |emily|  oh. oh my god. how can this be happening? what are we going to do?
ross| it's all right! everything's gonna be all right.|emily| how's it gonna be all right?!
ross| uh-huh, i see that.|monica|  okay, i talked to the guy with the shovel and i found out what happened. 
ross| what? what?|monica| they tore it down a few days early.
joey| all right! westminster abbey! hands down, best abbey i've ever seen. hey!  okay. what do you think of the abbey, chandler?|chandler| i think it's great. it's great. y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
joey| really? to what?|chandler| to put the camera away!!!
joey| man, you are westminster crabby. |monica| don't worry. you'll find some place to get married.
monica| oowww!!|dressmaker| sorry. lucky this dress is red!
emily| we can't find another place. then we can't have the wedding! i've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. what should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just sunday with a spectacular amount of food!|monica| you're gonna find a place. but even if - god forbid - you didn't.. so you postpone the wedding. is that really so bad? i mean, think about it. you could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. you could have tulips, you could have salmon.... mmmmm... salmon!!
emily| i suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... oh, thank you!|monica| but either way... you're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me.
monica| oh, god... she's told you that already, didn't she?!|phoebe| oh. oh.
rachel| oh, honey! don't get up! what do you need?|phoebe| oh, no. oh, nothing.
rachel| come on! i am here to take care of you! what do you need? anything.|phoebe| okay, i have a wedgie.
rachel| okay, that is all you.|phoebe| so-so, what do you want for lunch?
rachel| oh, i don't know. i guess we have to eat.|phoebe| yeah, i do. what's the matter?
rachel| i'm just bummed about the way i left things with ross. i shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. he seemed so mad at me.|phoebe| eh, don't be so hard on yourself. if someone i was still in love with was getting married...
rachel|  still in love with?! |phoebe| yeah!
rachel| i'm not in love with ross!|phoebe| oh. no. no. good! yeah, me neither.
rachel| phoebe, i'm going to ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. not because, i'm still in love with him! i mean, hey, y'know, i like ross as much as the next guy, y'know? clearly i have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! i mean, i still have loving feelings for ross. yeah! but, i have, i have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that i'm still in love with him. y'know? i-i have sexual feelings for him, but i do love him-ohh! oh my god! oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!|phoebe| we thought you knew!
rachel| we?!|phoebe| yeah, we all know! we talk about it all the time!
rachel| you all know? does ross know?|phoebe| oh no, ross doesn't know anything.
rachel| oh, i can not believe you didn't tell me!|phoebe| well, because we thought you knew!! it's so obvious! god, that would be like telling monica, \hey, you like things clean.\ or, y'know, \hey, joey, you're gay.\
rachel| what?!|phoebe| oh, please! she's always got a broom in her hand!
joey| hey!|the vendor| so, what are you guys in the market for? we've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
joey| check this out? huh?  yeah. that's the stuff. what do you think?|chandler| well, i don't have to buy that, \i'm with stupid\ t-shirt anymore.
joey| well, i like it. here you go. |chandler| all right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
joey| oh, i embarrass you? |chandler| how can i answer that when i'm pretending i don't know you?
the vendor| he's just jealous. you'll fit right in; all londoners wear them!|chandler| oh really? then how come no one here is wearing them?
the vendor|  they're all tourists.|chandler| all right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
joey| oh yeah?  if you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? i choose the hat.|the vendor| good choice.
joey| thanks.|chandler| okay, wait. all right, that's it, okay, i'm out of here. i am not going to be embarrassed anymore! 
joey| how you doin'? joey tribbiani, america.|emily| hello?
ross| hey! i just spoke to your dad, and you know what? he seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.|emily| we don't have to.
ross| whoa-whoa-what? you found a place?|emily| no. but, monica and i were talking, and-and i was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
ross| she said what?|emily| she said, \if i'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.\
ross| postpone it? emily, do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?  this isn't right.|emily| i realise that people are going to be disappointed. but, i'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
ross| i can't ask people to do that? would you ask people to do that? |emily| don't you point your pants at me!  we have no choice! anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, ross don't you understand? this is our wedding i'm talking about.
ross| the only thing i understand is; postponing it is not an option. this is when we're getting married.|emily| so what are you saying? it's now or never?
ross| no. i'm saying it's now. |emily| or?
ross| there's no 'or' in mind. what is wrong with these pants?!!|emily| it's not the pants. it's you that is backwards. and if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all! 
ross| |phoebe| hey!
rachel|  hi.|phoebe| so, did shopping make you feel any better about ross?
rachel| manhattan does not have enough stores.|phoebe| well, i think i can help you get over him.
rachel| you can?|phoebe| yeah. i just need you to bring me some photos of ross.
rachel| um-hmm.|phoebe| and a small piece of chocolate.
rachel| okay.|phoebe| and a glass of tepid water. 
rachel| ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?|phoebe| uh, only if you have the hiccups too. yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. i just didn't feel like getting up. okay, i'm gonna show you a picture of ross. okay? and you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. all right? really focus on his flaws.
rachel| i can do that. i certainly did it when we were going out.|phoebe| okay. umm, before we get started, i just wanna say for the record that i love ross, i think he's such a great guy. here.  okay, now, close your eyes. and imagine that you're with ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. and you're-you're running your hands all over his body. and then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! hah?
rachel| i don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.|phoebe| okay, this is going to be harder than i thought. umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
rachel| okay.|phoebe| okay?
rachel| all right.|phoebe| so uh, now look at the picture...
rachel| okay.|phoebe| all right, and umm...  
rachel| ow!|phoebe| okay, how do you feel now?
rachel| well, i like you less!|chandler| well, this is just as boring in england.
joey| hey.|chandler| hey. 
joey| oh.  sorry!|chandler| no-no-no, y'know what? i really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, i mean that really wasn't cool. and if it makes you feel any better, i've had a really lousy day.
joey| me too.|chandler| yeah?
joey| noo!! i've had the best day ever! dude, check this out! now, i'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.|monica|  hey!
joey| sh-shh-shh! |joey|  okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat. 
fergie|  okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?|joey|  oh, chandler.
fergie| hi chandler!  |chandler| that's... that's was...
monica| oh my god!|joey| that's fergie baby!!
fergie| joey says you don't really like his hat, but i think it's kinda dashing.|joey|  so, i hear you're single now...
fergie| yeah, ummm, i don't like the hat that much. |chandler| how did you? how? how?
joey| well, i was trying to figure out how to get to buckingham palace, right? so, i'm in my map and-and... hey!|monica| hey!
ross| hi. i understand you had a little talk with emily.|monica|  yes, i did! and you are welcome!
ross| am i?! and was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!|monica| umm...
chandler| i'm gonna go to the bathroom.|joey| wait up! 
ross| hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?|monica| she said that?!
ross| yeah.|monica| why?!
ross| i don't know, i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.|monica| oh my god. you're even dumber than i am!
ross| excuse me?|monica| ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
ross| i don't know. a month?|monica| emily has probably been planning it since she was five! ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. that's what we did! we dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake  thanks. but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
ross| i had no idea. and that-that pillowcase thing, i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.|monica| sometimes we were.
ross| come on. you gotta help me figure out what to do. okay?|monica| okay.
ross| come on. |chandler| that was pretty intense huh?
joey| yeah.  hey, i hope ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!|chandler|  i hope he did!
phoebe| ooh! i thought of a good flaw! ross pops his gum!|rachel| oh, right!  wait a minute, i do that too.
phoebe| yeah, i know. it drives me crazy.|phoebe| i'll get it.
phoebe| hello.|joey|  hey, pheebs! it's joey!
phoebe| hey, joey! hey! ooh! ooh! i just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. and i was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then i figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.|joey| that just cost me four bucks. but uh listen, i just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
phoebe| ohh, they're having a great time with their aunt phoebe! aunt rachel hasn't been helpful at all. so, do you miss me?|joey| kinda, but i've just been having way too much fun.
phoebe| so you're not homesick yet?|joey| no, i don't think so.
phoebe| all right, the seven of us miss you.|joey| who's seven?
phoebe| y'know, me, rachel, the birds, the babies...|joey| ahh, the babies miss me?
phoebe| of course they do! or i'm just really hungry.|phoebe| ooh, the pizza guy's here!
joey| what? you ordered pizza without me?!|phoebe| yeah. but y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the joey special.
joey| two pizzas?!|phoebe| yep! okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
joey| wait, well, where did you get it from?! |emily| monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
monica| you'll see.|emily| i tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
emily| oh god.|ross| okay? but-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? and-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...
monica| and the musicians, look, they can go over here  you go.|ross| but-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. really, it's fine, whatever you want.
emily| it's perfect.|ross| and, i don't know, if it starts to rain...
emily| well then we'll get wet. |monica| ohh. and i don't even have a date.
rachel| pheebs?|phoebe| yeah?
rachel| do you remember where the duck food is?|phoebe| yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. why?
rachel|  because i'm going to london.|phoebe| what?! what do you mean you're going to london?
rachel| yeah, i have to tell ross that i love him. now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until i get back.  |phoebe| but what about all the \finding-his-flaws\ stuff we've been doing?
rachel| yeah, that didn't work.|phoebe| i-rachel, you can't go! ross loves emily!
rachel| yeah, i know, i know, i know he does. but i have to tell him how i feel! he deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.|phoebe| that's not why you're going! you're going because you hope he's gonna say, \yeah, i love you too, rach. forget that british chippy.\
rachel| ohh-do you think he will?!|phoebe| no! because he's in love with the british chippy! look, rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! y'know, it's too late! you missed you're chance! i'm sorry, i know this must be really hard, it's over.
rachel| y'know what? no. it's not over until someone says, \i do.\ |phoebe| i do! i do! i do!  ugh, like i can really chase you. i'm carrying a litter.
housekeeper| the waltham residence.|phoebe| oh...yes..is this..umm..emily's parents' house.
housekeeper| this is the housekeeper speaking. and by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. first one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.|phoebe| what are you saying?!
housekeeper| now, let us try that again, shall we?|phoebe| 
housekeeper| the waltham residence.|phoebe|  hello. this is phoebe buffay. i was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might i speak to miss emily waltham, please?
housekeeper| miss waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. goodbye.|phoebe| no no no, i'll be nice, i swear!!! could you just give me the number for where they are?
housekeeper| i'm afraid, i'm not at liberty to divulge that information.|phoebe| ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. and i have to warn somebody, alright. so if you don't give me that number then i'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to new glocken..shire.
housekeeper| hangs up.|phoebe| hello, hello. ohh, ohh, she knew i could kick her ass.

waiter| goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta. |joey|  everything's different here...i want to go home. i...i miss my family. i miss the coffee house. i can't even remember what phoebe looks like.

rachel| oh yeah! of course, i mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? i mean, so you said my name! y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, \i take thee circus freak.\ y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. it didn't mean anything. right?|ross| no! no! of course it didn't mean anything! i mean, uh well, i can understand why emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
rachel| right...|ross| but it absolutely didn't.  it didn't!! it didn't!!
joey|  ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with emily, so...|ross|  oh! oh-oh, the band's ready! well, i-i-we gotta do what the band says-i don't care about the stupid band!!
joey| you spit on me man! |ross| look, i'm sorry.
joey| emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?|rachel|  y'know when i locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because i was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
ross| oh, right!|rachel| get the hell out of there, y'know?
ross| |rachel| well, look at that, same thing.
chandler| listen, in the middle of everything if i scream the word, \yippee!\ just ignore me.|monica| oh my god, rachel! hi!
chandler| oh, hello rachel.|rachel| ross said my name. okay? my name. 
monica| how did you get in here?|rachel| if anybody asks, i'm your sister, joan. listen. c'mon, you guys. ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! 
chandler|  your sister joan is crazy.|rachel| y'know what? fine, i don't care. don't believe me, i know i'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
chandler| yes, we do. but, we have to change first.|monica| yes, i want to change. and why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
chandler| yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.|monica|  fifteen minutes.
rachel| okay.|rachel| hello? oh, pheebs!  it's phoebe!
chandler| oh, yay...|monica| great...
rachel| hi!|phoebe| hi, so what happened?
rachel| well, ross said my name.|phoebe| yeah, i know, but i don't think that means anything.
rachel| okay, pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? ninth grade, right? the obsession starts. all right? the summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. so then...|chandler|  hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
monica| but my clothes are-ohh! |chandler| wow, you look...
monica| no time for that!|joey| hey, dude, let me in. i got a girl out here!
chandler| well, i've got a girl in here.|joey| no you don't, i just saw you go in there with monica!
chandler| well, we're-we're hanging out in here!|joey| look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
chandler| well, i suppose i'd have to say you!! but, what if we're watching a movie in here?|monica| which we are, and-and we already paid for it. it's my giant!
joey| my giant? i love that movie!|monica| you really think this is okay?
chandler| well, ross and emily aren't gonna use it.|monica| oh, it's so beautiful. ohh! y'know, i-i don't know if i feel right about this.
chandler| oh mon-mon-mon-mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. the room expects sex. the room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. all of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.|monica| okay!
chandler| okay!|ross|  emily?!
chandler| nope, not under here!|monica| you didn't find her?
ross| no, i've looked everywhere!|chandler| well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
monica| yeah, i think you should keep looking!|chandler| yeah, for about 30 minutes.
monica| or 45.|chandler| wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. 
ross| no! for all i know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because i kept moving around. no, from now on, i'm staying in one place.  right here.|monica| well, it's getting late.
chandler| yeah, we're gonna go.|ross| actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
monica| ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for new york.|chandler| yeah, it's a very large plane.
ross|  that's cool.|chandler| but, we'll stay here with you.
ross| thanks guys!  i really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.|chandler| we have to leave for new york in an hour.
monica| i know, i've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?|chandler| we can't do that that's insane. i mean 'a' he could wake up and 'b' y'know, let's go for it.
ross| em-emily? |mr. waltham| no.
mrs. waltham| you can forget about emily, she's not with us.|mr. waltham| we've come for her things.
ross| wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?|mr. waltham| she's in hiding. she's utterly humiliated. she doesn't want to see you ever again.
mrs. waltham| we're very sad that it didn't work out between you and emily, monkey. but, i think you're absolutely delicious.|mr. waltham| excuse me, i'm standing right here!
mrs. waltham| oh yes, there you are.|rachel| 
mr. waltham| goodbye geller.|ross| now, hold on! hold on!  that's all! now just tell emily that i love her and that i can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
mr. waltham| all right, i'll tell her.  come on bugger face!|mrs. waltham|  call me.
mr. waltham| you spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!|monica| y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
chandler| yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  y'know, technically we still are over international waters.|monica| i'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe i'll see you there in a bit?
chandler| 'kay!|joey| can i ask you something?
chandler| uhh, no.|joey| felicity and i, we're watching my giant, and i was thinking, \i'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant.\ do you think i'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
chandler| no.|joey| i mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think i'll ever get there?
chandler| yes.|joey| thanks man. 
chandler| okay man. |joey| but what about how much taller he is than me?
joey| i mean, there's no way i can make myself taller now, y'know? and who knows what science will come up with in the future, but chandler, what if i die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?|joey| hey, monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
monica| i know!|joey| had the beef-tips, huh?

gate agent||ross| i get it! well, that's that.
rachel| no, you know what, i think you should go.|ross| what?

phoebe| no-no-no! we haven't started yet. where's alice?|frank| uh, delaware. she's on her way though, so until she gets here, i'm gonna be your coach. but don't worry, she told me all about the la-mazada stuff.
chandler| yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.|frank| yeah.
rachel|  monica? you gonna be very proud of me. i just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.|joey| oh my!
rachel| they're male nurses.|joey| not in my head.
rachel| anyway, they want to take us out saturday night! what do you say?|monica| umm.  umm. umm. i don't think so.
rachel| what? what are you talking about?! you-you're the one who's been telling me to get over ross and move on. i'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.|monica| umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then i'll tell you if it's true.
rachel| what?|monica| harder than it sounds. isn't it?
rachel| okay, you're coming with me, and i also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some jell-o with them.|joey|  yep! there's always room for jell-o
rachel| joey, how do you make that dirty?|joey| oh, it's easy. yeah, i-i can do it with anything. watch uh,  grandma's chicken salad
joey| |phoebe| oh, okay, i'm having another one! this one doesn't hurt eitherooh, yes it does! ow! ow! ow! ow! ooh!  oh, i was kinda hoping that was it.
ross| hey, where are monica and rachel anyway?|joey| oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. maybe they're with them.
chandler| really? male nurses?|joey| yeah, i was bummed too.
chandler| so they're going on dates? when?|joey| i think saturday.
frank|  what's with him?|phoebe| umm, sympathy pains. i thought it was really sweet at first, but now i think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
dr. harad|  okay!|phoebe| hey.
dr. harad| let's see what we got here. ohh, y'know, fonzie dated triplets.|chandler| this-this fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
dr. harad| oh no-no-no. fonzie is the nickname of arthur fonzerelli. the fonz.|chandler| all right.
frank| it's not that weird, is it?|phoebe| it's very weird! i don't want some guy down there telling me, i'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
ross| to be fair, he doesnt seem to be impersonating fonzie|phoebe|  what are you doing?!! why are you defending him?! just get me another doctor! one who is not crazy and who is not fonzie!
ross| again, it's not that he|chandler|  oh-hey-hey-hey! there you are!
monica| umm, listen there's something i think you should know.|chandler| oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? yeah, joey already told me, and i am so-so fine. i mean, you and i we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
monica| umm, actually i was about to tell you that i was, i was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe i will go out with him.|chandler| fine! maybe i will too!
joey| |ross| okay, phoebe, this dr. oberman. he has no strong feelings about fonzie or any of the happy days gang.
phoebe| hi! and you're going into what grade?|dr. oberman| umm, i'm actually a first year resident, but i get that a lot, you see, i-i graduated early
phoebe|  uh-huh, me too. ross, maybe i should've specified that i'd be needing a grown up doctor. |dr. oberman| oh no, i'm fully qualified to
phoebe| shh! doogie, shh! doesn't anybody understand that i'm gonna be having babies soon? huh? go! go little boy, go!|frank| oh cool! you made him cry!
joey| umm, well, what else could it be?|joey| or?
dr. harad| all right, you're getting there. oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.|phoebe| they are. why?
dr. harad| they have the honor of being born on the fonz's half-birthday.|phoebe| happy birthday!
dr. harad| just-just to clarify, i'm not fonzie. |rachel| honey, y'know i just gotta tell you, i think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for frank and alice.
phoebe| i know, it is.|rachel| yeah!
phoebe| can i tell you a little secret?|rachel| yeah!
phoebe| i want to keep one. |rachel| ohh, i'm gonna be on the news!
rachel| okay, phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. i mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!|phoebe| why not?! maybe i can, you don't know!
rachel| yes! yes! yes, i do! i do know! frank and alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!|phoebe| maybe not! y'know? seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. listen, i-i hate to miss an opportunity just because i didn't ask! y'know?
rachel| phoebe, no! this is, this is insane.|phoebe| oh, just ask him!
rachel| me?!|phoebe| i can't ask him! do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! all i'm saying is just talk to frank. okay? just, y'know, feel him out!
rachel| no! forget it! i am not gonna ask frank to give you one of his kids!!|phoebe| you're right. 
phoebe| tell him it's for you.|monica| feeling a little better sweetie?
joey| well, maybe a little. i wish you hadn't seen me throw up.|monica| me too.

chandler| y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am so bad at this.|monica| i think you're better than you think you are.
chandler| really? okay, so|monica|  know when to stop.

all| yeah, sure yeah. yeah.|phoebe| so, here you are. it seems like yesterday i was talking to you in that little petri dish. everyone said labor was the hardest thing i'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. oh, i had the most fun with you guys! i wish i could take you home and see you everyday. okay, i'll settle for being your favorite aunt. i know alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. okay, so we're cool. yeah, we're gonna be great. little high fives! 
monica| phoebe, we are so proud of you! you're amazing!|phoebe| i know.
rachel| so does it really hurt as bad as they say?|phoebe| yeah. you won't be able to take it.
chandler| so uh, now that little chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?|phoebe| they're gonna call her chandler.
chandler| that's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?|phoebe| works on you.

monica|  okay, i'm sorry! i'm sorry! i-i-i was um, i was taking a nap.|rachel| since when do take naps in that position. oh god monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
monica| yes. yes, i was. a guy. from work.  i'm seeing a guy from work! ha!|rachel|  that cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening ray liotta?
monica| uh-huh, that one!|rachel| y'know what, just give me a second and i'll be out of your hair. i'm just gonna grab a jacket. when i get back, i want every little detail. 
monica|  it's just joey and ross.|rachel| why aren't you guys at the movie?
joey| well, we were! but ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!|ross| i had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
joey|  he's talking to london!|monica| but why?! did he get in touch with emily?
joey| well no, not yet. he's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.|ross|  i-i-i don't care if i said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
joey| ross! way to suck up to the family.|chandler| -enh-enh. i'm so glad you guys are all here! my office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
joey|  hey!|chandler| oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! no-no, vomit tux!
joey| don't worry, i had it dry-cleaned.|monica| vomit tux? who vomited ony'know what, what you up to joe?
joey| well, i'm doing this telethon thing on tv and my agent got me a job as co-host!|monica| oh that's great!
joey| a little uh, good deed for pbs and a little tv exposure, now that's the kind of math joey likes to do!|phoebe| ugh, pbs!
monica| what's wrong with pbs?|phoebe| ugh, what's right with them?
joey| why dont you like pbs, pheebs?|phoebe| okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, i was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. so, i just thought that it'd make me feel better if i wrote to sesame street, 'cause they were so nice when i was a little kid! no one ever wrote back.
chandler| well y'know a lot of those muppets don't have thumbs.|phoebe| all i got was a lousy key chain! and by that time i was living in a box. i didn't have keys!
joey| i'm sorry pheebs, i just, y'know, i just wanted to do a good deed. like-like you did with the babies.|phoebe| this isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on tv! this is totally selfish.
joey| whoa! whoa! whoa! what about you, having those babies for your brother? talk about selfish!|phoebe| what-what are you talking about?!
joey| well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?|phoebe| yeah. so?
joey| it made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.|phoebe| yes there are! there are totally good deeds that are selfless.
joey| well, may i ask for one example?|phoebe| yeah, it's y'know there'sno you may not!
joey| that's because all people are selfish.|phoebe| are you calling me selfish?!
joey| are you calling you people?  yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. okay? and you the deal on santa clause right?|phoebe| i'm gonna find a selfless good dead. i'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
ross|  hello.|emily|  hello, ross?
ross| emily? emily! oh my god! oh my god, it's emily!  hi!|emily| ross, i'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. good-bye!
ross| no wait! look, wait! okay, you can hang up, but i'm gonna keep calling! i'm gonna, i'm gonna call everyone in england if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!|emily| really? about what?
ross| look you're my wife. we're-we're married. y'know? i-i love you. i-i really miss you.|emily| i miss you to. well, at least i think i do.
ross|  she's talking.|all| 
phoebe| hey, joey, when you said the deal with santa clause, you meant?|joey| that he doesn't exist.
phoebe| right. |rachel| so chandler, have you heard about monica's secret boyfriend?
chandler| uhh, yeah. she uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.|rachel| so mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
monica| ohh, he's really shy. i-i dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet.|chandler| yeah, i don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
rachel| i dont care! i wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!|chandler| really?! that's what you heard?  you said that?
monica| i might've said that.  why is that funny?|chandler| because i'm very happy for him!  and you, you lucky dog!
ross|  hi!|monica| hey!
ross| well, emily's willing to work on the relationship.|chandler| yes!
monica| that's great!|ross| in london!
monica| what?!|ross| she wants me to move to london.
monica| but you live here!  you know that.|rachel| what-what-what are you gonna do?
ross| i bet if i talk to carol and susan i can convince them to move to london with ben.|monica| yeah, i'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
ross| it could happen.|joey|  how ya doin'? welcome. good to see ya!
stage director| this will be your phone.|joey| that's great. but uh, i'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
stage director| no you answer it and take pledges.|joey| but i'm the host!
stage director| no, gary collins is the host. you'll be answering the phones.|joey| you don't seem to understand. see, i was dr. drake remoray.
stage director| well, here's your phone doctor. |phoebe| i cannot believe i can't find a selfless good deed! y'know that old guy that lives next to me? well, i snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. but he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. then i felt wonderful. that old jackass!
rachel| maybe joey's right. maybe all good deeds are selfish.|phoebe| i will find a selfless good deed! 'cause i just gave birth to three children and i will not let them be raised in a world where joey is right!
chandler|  hey, monica? can i ask you a cooking question?|monica| sure!
chandler| if you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than richard?|rachel| chandler!  is he?
monica| well, y'know i-i-i think i'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.|chandler| why?! i mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, i'd be going like this. 
ross| all right emily, as much as i love you, i'm sorry, i can't move to london without ben.|emily| i understand that would be difficult.
ross| yeah, would you please consider moving here? i mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?|emily| i don't know, it's just
ross| oh-oh-okay, but-but i know, that even though i've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, i mean, i mean you-you-you have to come here. you have to come here so we can work this out.|emily| all right.
ross| all right, did you just say all right?|emily| i did. now i'm the idiot.
ross| oh, emily that is, that is so great. it's gonna be so great! we're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!|emily| ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
ross| yes, tell me.|emily| well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
ross| i know. i am, i am so sorry.|emily| and then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
ross| again, very sorry.|emily| i mean, i can't-i can't be in the same room as her! it drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
ross| emily, there is nothing between rachel and me. okay? i love you.|emily| all right. i'll come to new york and we'll try and make this work.
ross| oh that is so great! that's|emily|  as long as you don't see rachel anymore.
ross| so i asked emily if she would come to new york, and she said yes.|chandler| yes!
phoebe| ooh-ohh!|monica| great!
ross| no-no-no! only if i promise never to see rachel again.|phoebe| why?
monica| what?! you can'twhat did you tell her?|ross| i told her i'd have to think about it. i mean, how the hell am i supposed to make this kind of a decision?  i'm actually asking you!
chandler| well, you can't just not see rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.|monica| yeah! but, he can't not exactly see emily, i mean that's his wife.
phoebe| yeah.|chandler| that's true!
phoebe| yeah, but you've known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life.|chandler| that's true!
monica| no, you cannot.|ross| thanks for the help, problem solved. 
monica|  hello.|joey|  hey mon!

monica| a magic eight ball?! you can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!|phoebe| ooh, it's not a toy.
ross| well, i don't know what else to do. i mean, i either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or i keep my friend and get divorced the second time before i'm 30! so-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'cause i-i got nothing! all right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.  ask again later. what the hell! this is broken! it-it is broken!|monica| all right, let me see.  don't count on it. seems like it works to me.
joey|  pbs telethon.|phoebe|  hi joey.
joey| hey pheebs!|phoebe| i would like to make a pledge. i would like to donate $200.
joey| $200? are you sure pheebs? i mean, after what sesame street did to ya?|phoebe| oh, i'm still mad at them but i also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, i'm doing a good thing, but i'm not happy about it. so there, a selfless good deed.
joey| and you don't a little good about donating the money?|phoebe| no, it sucks. i was saving up to buy a hamster.
joey| a hamster? what, those things are like 10 bucks.|phoebe| yeah, not the one i had my eye on.
gary collins|  mr. joseph tribbiani!|phoebe| oh, look-look, joey's on tv! isn't that great? my pledge got joey on tv! oh that makes me feeloh no! 
chandler|  look, maybe i got carried away before. but there's something you gotta know. if i'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.|monica| keep talking.
chandler| i mean i was nothing before you. call the other girls and ask. which wouldn't take long. but when i'm with you, and we're together, ohmygod.|monica| really?
chandler| oh-aw my god! now, i understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. we're too good! we owe it, to sex!|monica| well, if we owe it?  oh my when is joey gonna be home?
chandler| well, i was kinda hoping we could do this without him.  oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.|monica| but, i just cleaned the bathroom.
chandler| yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.|monica| yeah. 
chandler| all right, let's show them how it's done.|monica| okay.
monica| ow!|chandler| y'know that wasn't part of it?
monica| i know!|rachel|  hi! are you ready? we're gonna be late!
ross| for what?|rachel| for stella! remember? she's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
ross| yeah, i uh, totally forgot about that. you mind if i take a rain check? i'm waiting for a call from emily.|rachel| sure. i guess. hey, i hear you don't have to go to london. yay!
ross| it's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.|rachel| like what?
ross| just stuff. y'know kinda what emily wants.|rachel| well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe i can help.
ross| no. no. you-you can't help. i mean, i kinda have to do this without your help.|rachel| well, i-i know you can do that too. i'm just, i'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to hi!
ross| thanks.|rachel| ross? look, whatever this relationship stuff that emily wants, just give it to her. come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. so just fix whatever she wants fixed. just do it.  oh come on answer it! it's driving me crazy!
ross| |monica| never done that before.
chandler| |joey| monica? what time is it?
chandler| uhh, 9. |joey| but it's dark out.
monica| well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! this is what 9 looks like.|joey| i guess i'll get washed up then. watch that sunrise. 
monica| i'm really getting tired of sneaking around.|chandler| i know, me too. hey! y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
monica| all weekend? that's a whole lotta naked.|chandler| yeah, i can say that i have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
monica| ohh, i've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in jersey!|chandler| okay, y'know your not though. let's go. 
monica| wait! what about joey?|monica|  hey, guess what i'm doing this weekend! i'm going to this culinary fair in new jersey.
phoebe| oh weird, chandler just told us he's got a conference there!|monica| oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like chandler's conference could've been in connecticut or vermont.
chandler| i'm not in charge of where the conference is held. do you want people to think it's a fake conference? it's a real conference.|ross|  hey.
joey| hey!|monica| hey.
ross| is rachel here? i gotta talk to her.|monica| no, she's out shopping.
ross| damn!|chandler| what's going on?
ross| i told emily to come. and i just need to y'know, talk to rachel about it.|phoebe| wait a minute! so when emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see rachel anymore?
ross| well look, i'm just trying to focus on the \i get to see my wife,\ part, all right? and not the part that makes me do this. |monica| wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? how is that even gonna work?
ross| i have no idea. i mean but-but i assure you i will figure it out.|joey| doesnt seem like it's going to work, i mean
rachel|  hi, guys!|joey| hi!
chandler| uh, hey!|rachel| what's going on?
chandler| we're flipping monica's mattress.|joey| so i'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
phoebe| yeah that's better than my way.|rachel| oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
chandler| aww, man! |rachel|  oh look! a letter from my mom.
ross| so, rach, y'know-y'know how emily's coming right?|rachel| oh yeah! i know.
phoebe|  can you hear anything?|chandler| oh yes, somebody just said, \can you hear anything?\
monica| hey, joey's ass! what are you doing?|joey|  well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? well, when ross said rachel at the wedding, i figured it was gonna happen again, so i hid this in here.
monica| ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles|phoebe| ooh, madlibs, mine! 
chandler| condoms?|joey| you don't know how long we're gonna be in here! we may have to repopulate the earth.
chandler| and condoms are the way to do that?|ross| anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time i talked to emily
rachel|  oh my god! my dog died!|ross| what?!
rachel| oh my god, le poo, our dog!|ross| le poo's still alive?!
rachel| oh god, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine- oh my god.|monica| sweetie, we heard you crying. please don't cry.
rachel| it's le poo.|phoebe| i know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
chandler|  i can't believe it! we're here!|monica| ooh, chocolates on the pillows! i love that!
chandler| oh, you should live with joey, roll-os everywhere.|monica| come here.  okay, be right back. 
chandler| oh yes! monica, get in here! there's a high-speed car chase on!|monica| we're switching rooms.
chandler|  oh dear god, they gave us glasses!|monica| no, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! i mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.  come on sweetie, i just want this weekend to be perfect, i mean we can change rooms, can't we?
chandler| okay, but let's do it now though, because chopper 5 just lost it's feed! |ross| hey, so uh, y'know how there's something i wanted to talk to you about?
rachel| oh yeah! |ross| well, y'know how i'm trying to work things out with emily. well, there's this one thing okay, -oh hey!
rachel| what?|ross| you're nose is bleeding!
rachel| oh god.  oh, okay, so i'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?|ross| umm 
rachel| sorry. sorry.|ross| okay, i uh, i can't see you anymore.
rachel| yeah, i know. it's ridiculous! i can't see you either.|hotel clerk| i think you'll find this room more to your liking.
chandler| okay, great. |hotel clerk|  they say he's only got half a tank left.
chandler| half a tank? we still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!|monica| we're switching rooms again.
chandler| what? why?|monica| this is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
hotel clerk| our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.|monica|  excuse me, umm, can i talk to you over here for just a second?
chandler| uh-huh. |monica| chandler!
chandler|  yeah.|monica| look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and i'm not gonna let 'em! and we're not a couple of suckers!
chandler| i hear ya, mugsy! but look, all these rooms are fine okay? can you just pick one so i can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.|monica| okay, this one i like!
chandler|  nothing! it's over! dammit! this is regularly scheduled programming!|monica| can we turn the tv off? okay? do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
chandler| oh, i'm sorry, am i getting in the way of all the room switching fun?|monica| hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
chandler| oh, who should i blame? the nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?|monica| i don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from albany to canada on a half a tank of gas!
chandler| do not speak ill of the dead.|monica| we're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
chandler| i just want to watch a little television. what is the big deal? geez, relax mom.|monica| what did you say?
chandler| i said, \geez, relax monnnnn.\|rachel| hi!
ross| hey. rachel, i-i-i've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and i really, i just have to get it out.|rachel| okay, what's up?
ross| okay, y'know how you told me i should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?|rachel| yeah, i told you to give emily whatever she wants.
ross| and while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants |rachel| yeah?
ross| is for me not to see you anymore.|rachel| that's crazy! you can't do that! what are you going to tell her?  oh god. ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
ross| it's awful i know, i mean, i feel terrible but i have to do this if i want my marriage to work. and i do, i have to make this marriage work. i have too. but the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.|rachel| ohh! lucky me! oh my god! that is good news, ross! i think that's the best news i've heard since le poo died!
ross| you have no idea what a nightmare this has been. this is so hard.|rachel| oh yeah, really? is it ross? yeah? okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
ross| what are you doing?|rachel| storming out!
ross| rachel, this is your apartment.|rachel| yeah, well that's how mad i am!!
chandler| damn rollos!|joey| hey, you're back!
chandler| hey.|joey| how was your conference?
chandler| it was terrible. i fought with |joey| oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
chandler| uh, no, i got to see donald trump waiting for an elevator.|monica|  hi!
joey| hey, you're back too!|monica| yeah. umm, chandler can i talk to you outside for a second?
joey| hey, how was your chef thing?|monica| oh, it was awful.  i guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
chandler| well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.|monica| chandler! 
chandler| monica. |monica| okay, i'd like to know how much the room was because i'd like to pay my half.
chandler| okay, fine, $300.|monica| 300 dollars?!
chandler| yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!|monica| urghh!!
joey|  what are you guys woofing about?|monica| chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
joey| nooooo!!! y'know what? now that i think about it, i constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!|ross| you should've seen the look on her face. i don't want rachel to hate me! i don't know what to do.
joey| you want my advice?|ross| yes! please!
joey| you're not gonna like it.|ross| that's okay.
joey| you got married to fast.|ross| that's not advice!
joey| i told ya.|ross| i'm going to the bathroom. 
joey| man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, i couldn't do it.|chandler and phoebe| yeah, me either.
monica| maybe i could do it.|rachel|  hi!
joey| hi, rach.|chandler| hi!
phoebe| hey.|monica| hey.
rachel| look, i know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and ross but y'know, i've been obsessing about it all day and i'd just love not to talk about it. all right?|joey| i-i-i don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, ross is right back there. 
rachel| that's not ross!|phoebe| oh no! not that guy! he does look like him though.
chandler| okay, ross is in the bathroom.|rachel| oh my god, its happening. it's already started. i'm kip.
joey| hey, you're not kip!|rachel|  do you even know who kip is?
joey| who cares? you're rachel!  who's kip?|chandler| kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
joey| oh, that poor bastard.|rachel| see? yeah, you told me the story. he and monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? he got phased out!
monica| you're not gonna be phased out!|rachel| well, of course i am! it's not gonna happen to ross! he's your brother.  he's your old college roommate. ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. i just always assumed phoebe would be the one to go.
phoebe| ehh!!|rachel| honey, come on! you live far away! you're not related. you lift right out.
chandler|  hey!|joey| hey, mr. bing. that uh, hotel you stayed at called. said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
chandler| yes that was mine.|joey| 'cause i figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
chandler| yes that would have made more sense.|joey| y'know, i-i don't even feel like i know you anymore man! all right, look, i'm just gonna ask you this one time. and whatever you say, i'll believe ya.  were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
rachel| phoebe?  you gotta come with me!|phoebe| come where?
rachel| wherever i go. come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.|phoebe| okay, but try and get joey too.
ross|  pheebs, you mind if i speak to rachel alone for a sec?|phoebe| oh, sure!  forever.
ross| hi.|rachel| hi. what are you doing here? isn't this against the rules?
ross| i talked to monica, look, i'm the one who made the choice. i'm the one who's making things change, so i should be the one to y'know, step back.|rachel| oh, ross
ross| no, no, it's okay. really. they're plenty of people who just see their sisters at thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see joey at burger king. so is, is that better?|rachel| no, it's not better. i still don't get to see you.
ross| well, what-what would you do? rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?|rachel| well, for starters i would've said the right name at my wedding!
ross| i can't believe this is happening.|rachel| i know.
ross| i am so sorry.|rachel| i know that too.
joey|  hey, rach? sorry to interrupt but umm, phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.|chandler|  hey!
monica| hi.|chandler| i just came over to drop offnothing. so that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
monica| yeah, it did.|chandler| so, i guess this is over.
monica| what?|chandler| well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
monica| why, exactly?|chandler| because of the weekend, we had a fight.
monica| chandler that's crazy! if you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanohhh! |chandler| so, this isn't over?
monica|  you are so cute! no. no, it was a fight. you deal with it and move on! it's nothing to freak out about.|chandler| really? okay. great!
monica| ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! |chandler|  we're in a relationship?
monica| i'm afraid so.|chandler| okay.
phoebe| hey!|monica| hey!
phoebe| oh hey, monica, i heard you saw donald trump at your convention.|monica| yeah, i saw him waiting for an elevator.
monica| hey, rach, can i borrow your eyelash curler, i think i lost mine.|rachel| yeah, it's in there. 
joey|  oh! ohh! oh!!|chandler| joey, can i talk to you for a second? 
joey| oohh!! ohh! oh-oh-oh! oh-oh!!|joey| ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
chandler| yes. yes. |joey|  and-and you?!
monica| yes, but you cannot tell anyone! no one knows!|joey| how?! when?!
chandler| it happened in london.|joey| in london!!!
chandler| the reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.|joey| but it is a big deal!! i have to tell someone! 
chandler| no-no-no-no-no! you can't!|monica| please? please?! we just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? just promise you won't tell.
joey| all right! man, this is unbelievable! i mean, it's great, but|monica| i know, it's great!
joey| aww, i don't want to see that!|phoebe| we're so stupid! do you know what's going on in there? they're trying to take joey!
phoebe| the most popular phoebe in tennis is called the overhand phoebe. and if you win, you must slap your opponent on the phoebe and say, \hi, phoebe!\|monica| oh that's cute! we really all enjoyed it. but y'know, it doesn't count.
phoebe| count for what?|monica| count in our heads as-as good madlibs.
joey| i guess i'm done.|chandler| fun's over!
monica| wait-wait, guys! if-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!|rachel| uh-huh!
joey| i think i'm gonna take-off.|monica| guys, rules are good! rules help control the fun! 
joey|  hey! hey! hey! hey!! none of that, not while you're living under my roof!|monica| what?!
joey| look, just because i know about you two, doesn't mean i like looking at it.|chandler| aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
joey| well, i'm sorry if i'm not a middle-aged black woman!  and i'm also sorry if sometimes i go to the wrong audition! okay, look, if i have to pretend i don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.|chandler and monica| okay.
monica| sorry.|chandler| sorry.
joey|  i can hear that!|monica|  rachel's at work.
joey| i can still hear you!|phoebe| hey!
joey| hey!|chandler| hello!
monica| hey, what's that?|phoebe| yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. can you believe it?! a year ago i didn't even have a family, and now i have heirlooms for crying out loud.
phoebe| eeeee-|joey| argh-argh!!  ooh, soft. is this mink?
phoebe| yeah! why would my mother send me a fur? doesn't she know me but at all! plus, i have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|chandler| yeah, just some 9-year-old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  that didn't happen, i made that up!
ross|  hey!|gunther| oh, ross? ross! you can't put up flyers in here.
ross| how come? everybody else does.|gunther| you can't.
monica| what is that?|ross| oh, umm, i'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
monica|  this is all of your things.|ross| yes, yes it is! no, but it's good it'semily thinks we should get all new stuff. stuff that's just ours, together. y'know brand new.
monica| so basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-rachel-ever-used sale.|ross| touched. used. sat on. sleep on.
gunther| i'll take it all.|joey| hey, ross, you're okay with that?
ross| look, if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york, i'm sure everything will be fine.|chandler| okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
ross| after what i did? can you blame her?|phoebe| oh my god! you got off easy! when my friend silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
joey|  what is he doing? what, emily, thinks ross's furniture has got rachel coodies?|monica| now calm down joey.
joey| no! everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? emily won't let ross see rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing rachel, hence ross stops seeing us!|phoebe| oh, i hate this. everything's changing.
chandler| yeah i know, we're losing ross, joey said hence|monica| look, i'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about emily to ourselves. are you cool with that?
joey| no! but y'know, i'm an actor, i'll act cool.|rachel| ohh, whoa god! storage rooms give me the creeps! monica, come on please hurry up honey! please? 
monica| rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until i find the little waffle iron.|rachel| i want the little round waffles.
monica| all right.  op, here it is! right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. i wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?|rachel| okay, y'know what? i'll-i'll have toast!
rachel| arghhhh!!!!!!|monica| oh my god! fog him! fog him!
phoebe| i don't know what i'm gonna do about this coat.|joey| i'll take it!
phoebe| that might work! |joey| ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  enh? all right, what do you think?
chandler| you're on in 5 ms. minnelli. |ross| 
joey| what's the matter ross?|ross| nothing. oh, actually, great news! i just got off the phone with emily and it looks like i'm moving to a new apartment. woo-hoo!
phoebe| why?|ross| well, her thought is, and i agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and columbia on the other.
joey| that's way uptown! that's like three trains away!  which is great! i love to ride that rail!|chandler| so you're really okay with this?
ross| yes! yes! i mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, i'll get so much done on the commute. i-i've been given the gift of time!|chandler| now that's so funny, because last christmas i got the gift of space. we should get them together and make a continuum.
joey| now he's movin'? man, what is emily doing to him?  ow!! he's not even here!!!|rachel| you guys! you guys!
monica| we were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!|rachel| it was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! he was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
monica| and he came at us with an axe, so rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!|rachel|  yeah, i-i-i just pulled the tab and i just fogged his yeti ass!
joey| uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?|rachel| yeah!
joey| yeah, you fogged danny.|rachel| please! we did not fog danny! who's danny?
joey| dan just moved in downstairs. yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the andes. nice fella. |monica| oh he's nice. he's nice! y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
danny| yeah?|rachel| hi! you might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
monica| we're-we're really sorry we fogged you.|danny| okay. 
rachel| hi! just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.|danny| okay.
danny| yesss?|rachel| hi! sorry to bother you, but i don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
monica| yeah.|danny| o-kay!
monica| wow! that guy is so rude!|rachel| really! what is with that guy? i mean you'd forgive me if i fogged you.
monica| well you did a little bit.|rachel| oh my god, honey, i'm so sorry!
monica| i totally forgive you!|rachel| really?
monica| yes!|phoebe| hey!
monica| hey!|phoebe| so listen, you know my friend chris who owns the crematorium? 
monica| crematorium chris? sure!|phoebe| he says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if i umm, y'know, bring in the next person i know who dies.
rachel| oh my god! oh my god, look at these pelts!|monica| don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
rachel| what? uhh, phoebe, honey, honey, i know you're quirky and i get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! not nature, fashion!|phoebe| this is fashion?!  'cause i do.
ross| |chandler| okay, what is in here? rocks?
ross| no-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.|chandler| so, rocks. 
ross| i'm really gonna miss this apartment. y'know, ben-ben took his first steps right over there. |joey| ohh. hey, remember when i ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?
ross| i loved this place! to tell you the truth, i wish i didn't have to move.|joey| uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
ross| well, i mean if uh, if emily gave me a choice|joey| you do have a choice!! ross, why are you listening to her?! are you, are you crazy?!
ross| why?|joey| it's not right what emily wants you to do! she is totally--owww!! stop pinching me! look, now you guys said i only had to keep my mouth shut as long as ross was happy, right? well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
ross| what's going on?|joey| we all hate emily!
phoebe| nooo!!|monica| no, ross, we do not hate emily. we-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
joey| yeah!|chandler| look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
joey| yes! yes! unreasonable!|ross| unreasonable? how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! all right, it's about compromise! do you always like it? no! do you do it? yes! because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at central perk all the time! it's real life, okay? it's what grown-ups do! 
phoebe| i think he's right. you guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.|monica| god, i feel so guilty about ross.
phoebe| oh, i know.|joey| i kinda feel like it's my fault.
chandler| kind of? if you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.|joey| well, i'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! 
chandler| well, i think it's very brave what you said.|phoebe| all right, i can't sit here anymore. i have to walk places. 
chandler| pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? how about the whole animal rights thing?|phoebe| well, i've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. okay, i admit it! i love this coat! okay, iit's the best thing i've ever had wrapped around me, including phil huntley!  remember phil huntley? he was fine!

joey| i know, i know, but look at the knobs on her.|chandler| hey! 
ross| emily's cousin kicked me out!|chandler| what?! 
joey| why?|ross| well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
chandler| how can he do that? didn't you sign a lease?|ross| who needs a lease when it's family!
joey| hey, you can stay with us! we'll take care of ya!|chandler| oh, yeah! absolutely! anything you need man! but you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
joey| yeah.|ross| you got it.
joey| okay.|ross| thanks you guys, i really appreciate this. all right, i'm gonna get packing again. man, i've been moving around so much i'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
ross| what?|chandler| he thought you said gonad.
health inspector| wow, monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, i'd have a tough time making a living.|monica| oh, larry.
phoebe| umm, do health inspectors work on commission? |larry| no, bribes.
phoebe| it's okay to laugh right?|larry| yeah, i was just kidding.
phoebe| okay. |larry| i'll check the kitchen floors.
monica| okay, knock yourself out, larry.|phoebe| yum-my!
monica| larry?|phoebe| oh yeah! i'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
larry|  a 98. i deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a section 5 violation.|monica| uh, look, larry honey, umm, i wrote the book on section 5 and i know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
larry| and where is your hat?|monica| it's in the kitchen, i'll go get it. 
larry| ahh that's the 2 points.|phoebe| hey, you should really read that book you wrote.  wow! you saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. you can have your own health inspector detective show!
larry| oh, i don't know about that.|phoebe| yeah, but then i can be you sidekick vunda.
larry| maybe uh, vunda could give me her number and i can ask her to dinner sometime.|phoebe| okay, she would love that! y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
larry| i-i'll call ya.|phoebe| okay.
phoebe| he's so funny! |monica| thanks.
rachel| thank you.  mon?|monica| hmm?
rachel| how's ross doing? y'know since all the emily stuff.|monica| he's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try
rachel| oh, honey, please, no, i can't get started with all that ross stuff again. i mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. and besides y'know, i don't, i don't go for guys right after they get divorced.|monica| right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
danny|  two pounds of moca java please.|monica|  danny. are you guys ever gonna go out again?
rachel| i don't know! he hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. i see him in the hallway, we flirt, i'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.|danny|  hey!
rachel| hi danny!  wow! thirsty huh?|danny| uh, actually, actually, i'm having a party at my place on saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
monica| ohh, fun!|rachel| ohh, great!
danny| yeah, i'm really looking forward to it.|rachel| yeah.
danny| okay, see ya. |monica| well, i guess we won't be warming his house.
rachel|  okay. all right, i see what he's doing! he's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.|monica| and you're not gonna do that.
rachel| that's right! 'cause that would give him the control! so now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole i've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. blew up in his face, didn't it?|monica| so-so there is no party.
rachel| no, there's a party. there's a party. but the power, that is still up for grabs. you follow me?|monica| i think so. se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
rachel| exactly.|joey| ross?
ross|  hey roomies!|chandler| love what you've done with the place.

phoebe|  you are just nonstop!|larry|  we're outta here!
phoebe| why?!|larry| just walking past the kitchen i saw 10 violations! i'm shutting this place down!
phoebe|  you have the power to do that?|larry| this does. 
phoebe|  shut it down.|joey| hey.
chandler| what are you doing?|joey| nothing.

danny| take care. |rachel| okay.  walked right into that one didn't he?
monica| what one? you wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!|rachel| yeah, but he waited until the last minute! so if i said yes, he would know i had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. i said, \no!\ which puts me right back in the driver seat.
monica| great. so the ball is in his court?|rachel| ball? there is no ball.
ross| |joey| sorry.
joey| ahhhhhhhhhh |chandler|  hello children!
joey| hey! wanna play some foosball? please?|chandler| okay.

ross|  two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!|chandler| what about that circled one?
ross| oh, i-i don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.|joey| but it's available now! isn't it?
chandler| yes, it is.|joey| hey, let's go look at it! 
ross| okay, let's go.|joey| okay!
chandler| there we go!|ross| oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, i was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? i mean after all, we all are using it.
chandler| let's go quicker.|joey| yeah!
ross| oh my god! |chandler| yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. well that's great! y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
joey| somebody was using his head. hey, let's check out the rest of the place.|ross| i think this is it. i don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
joey| but hey, ross, this place is available now!|chandler| yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
joey| yeah.|ross|  so, you-you think i should go ahead and take this place?
joey| oh, it's perfect!|ross|  how about you?
chandler| it's a kitchen slash bathroom.|ross| all right, i see what you guys are saying. i'll uh, i'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
chandler| we are bad people.|joey| he knew we were trying to get rid of him. he knew!  you think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
larry|  hey, ready for dinner?|phoebe| ooh, absolutely!
larry| great! how about you wanted to go the italian place down on bleaker street right?|phoebe| ooh, i love that place!  so, no.

larry|  has been setting out.|phoebe| oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! thatthis milk is mine. i bought this today, 'cause i was thirsty for milk, y'know.  okay, let's go!
larry| hey, buddy!  are you familiar with section 11-b of the health code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?|gunther| but then i'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
larry| oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!|phoebe| okay, stop! larry, okay, can't you just be larry and not larry the health inspector guy? y'know i mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
larry| well, i suppose i could give him a warning.|phoebe| thank you.  now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, i know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
joey| maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping ross get back on his feet!|chandler| yes that was a nice place!
joey| yeah!|chandler| not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
joey| yeah!|chandler| what are we gonna do?

chandler| well, i see you've had a very productive day. don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?|ross|  come on, it's fun!
chandler| all right!  isn't this a woman's hat?|joey| dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
rachel| oh monica that was the best thanksgiving dinner ever! i think you killed us.|ross| i couldn't possibly eat another bite. 
joey| i need something sweet.|phoebe| does anyone wanna watch tv?
all| yeah, sure.|phoebe| monica your remote doesn't work.
monica| phoebe, you have to lift it and point.|phoebe| oh. aw, forget it.
rachel| yeah, you know what we should all do? we should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.|joey| ooh-ooh, i! i am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
monica| that's very nice.|chandler| that's sweet, joey.
joey| yeah, the other day i was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. oh! which reminds me, i'm also thankful for thongs. |joey| i mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. i mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! and the way they play with your mind! is it there? is it not there?
chandler| are you aware that you're still talking?|monica| is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
ross| huh, i don't know what to pick. am i more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? hmm.|phoebe| wow! see, and i didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
ross| i'm sorry. it's just that this is the worse thanksgiving ever.|chandler| no-no-no! i am the king of bad thanksgivings. you can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
rachel| oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?|ross| oh god, no.
joey| oh, come on! i wanna hear it! it wouldn't be thanksgiving without chandler bumming us out!|chandler| it's a tradition, like the parade. if the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
mrs. bing| now chandler dear, just because your father and i are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. it just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.|the housekeeper| more turkey mr. chandler? 
ross| you're right. yours is worse. you are the king of bad thanksgivings.|phoebe| i don't know about that. i've got one that's worse.
chandler| really? worse than, \more turkey mr. chandler?\|phoebe| oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? yes, mine's worse!
past life phoebe| more bandages! more bandages! please, can i get some more bandages in here! this man is dying oh no.|ross| in this life, phoebe.
phoebe| oh, this life! oh okay no, chandler's is worse.|joey| man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! i don't have any past life memories.
phoebe| of course you don't sweetie. you're brand new.|rachel| i know monica's worst thanksgiving.
monica| oh, let's not tell this story.|all| oh, come on!
phoebe| oh no, i know! i know! it's the one where joey got monica's turkey stuck on his head!|rachel| what?! joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!

monica| well, get it off now!|joey| i can't! it-it's stuck!
monica| well, i don't care! that-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!|phoebe| all right, hold on! okay, let's just all think.
monica| okay, i got it. phoebe? all right, you pull. i'm gonna spread the legs as wide as i can.  joey? now is not the time!|joey| sorry! sorry.

joey|  i scared you!|chandler|  you did look like an idiot.
joey| hey, i wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. all right? remember when ross tried to say, \butternut squash?\ and it came out, \squatternut buash?\|ross| yeah that's the same.
monica| that's it. that's my worse thanksgiving.|phoebe| oh wait! that can't be the one rachel's talking about. she didn't even know that happened. so which one was it?
all| which one?|monica| umm, i-i really don't want to tell this story.
chandler| oh, come on monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what thanksgiving is all about. y'know, for me anyway. and of course, the indians.|monica| look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!

monica| how?|rachel| well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
monica| what?! i mean, i didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that i can give my flower to someone like him!|rachel| okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! you're just gonna make him think that you are.
monica| yeah.|rachel| yeah.
monica| and when he's naked i can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!|rachel| then, you will definitely get him back!
monica| okay, so how do i make him think i wanna have sex with him?|rachel| okay, oh, here's what you do. just act like everything around you turns you on.
monica| what do you mean?|rachel| well, like anything can be sexy. like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!  ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! and-and if i feel a little hot, i can just dab myself with it. or i can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while i talk to him.
monica|  i can do that!|rachel| yeah? okay! good, good, because he's coming. he's coming. 
chandler| monica, i was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.|monica| umm, i'd love too!  ooh, i love macaroni and cheese. i love-i love the way this box feels against my cheek.

rachel| you brought a carrot?!|mrs. geller| oh my god! there's a toe in my kitchen.
monica| god, i'm sorry! i'll go back and get it!|the doctor| it's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
chandler| without my toe?! i need my toe!|monica| wait, no-no-no, i can go really fast! dad, give me the keys to your porsche!
mr. geller| oh, i'm not falling for that one!|chandler| that's why i lost my toe?! because i called you fat?!
monica| i didn't mean to cut it off. it was an accident.|chandler| that's why for an entire year people called me sir limps-a-lot?!
monica| i'm sorry! it wasn't your whole toe!|chandler| yeah, well, i miss the tip! it's the best part. it has the nail. 
monica| chandler! |ross|  sir limps-a-lot, i came up with that.

joey| yeah, it was! all right, listen, i can't|chandler|  all this lying has been hard on us too.
joey| oh-oh, yeah-yeah, i bet all the sex makes it easier!|chandler| well, yeah actually.
monica| we'll try to be more careful okay? it's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.|chandler| i know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
monica| we are! help us!|chandler| help!
joey| all right! but,  you do it with me once.|monica| joey!

chandler| well, what did the police say?|ross| my thanksgiving leftover sandwich. i can't believe someone ate it!
chandler| ross, it's just a sandwich!|ross| just a sandwich? look, i am 30 years old, i'm about to be divorced twice and i just got evicted! that sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
monica| okay, look, i-i have enough stuff for one more sandwich, i mean i was going to eat it myself, but |ross|  that-that would be incredible. thank you so much. i-i still can't believe someone ate it!! i mean, look, i left a note and everything. 
chandler|  knock-knock. who's there? ross geller's lunch. ross geller's lunch, who? ross geller's lunch, please don't take me. okay?|joey| i'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
phoebe| okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? you gotta scare people off. i learned that living on the street.|ross| really?! so what would you say pheebs? stuff like uh, \keep your mitts off my grub?\
chandler| say ross, when you picture phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of annie?|phoebe| okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. 
all| whoa! ohh!!|monica| phoebe, you are a bad ass!
phoebe| someday i'll, tell you about the time i stabbed the cop.|monica| phoebe?
phoebe| well, he stabbed me first!!|rachel|  sorry i'm late, but i left late.
phoebe| okay.|rachel| so pheebs, what is the book about?
phoebe| i thought you said you read it in high school.|rachel| well yeah, but then i remembered i started it and there was this pep rally and i was, i was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about?
phoebe| okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between cathy and heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in england. which i think represents the wildness of heathcliff's character. i totally get symbolism.|the teacher| how would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , rachel green?
rachel| umm, well i would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.|the teacher| well, that's sort of a given, but yes. anyone else?
rachel| oh-oh-oh, symbolism! and uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which i think is-is mirrored in the wildness of heathcliff's character.|the teacher| excellent! what rachel has shrewdly observed here
phoebe|  you completely stole my answer!|rachel| well, honey that was pretty obvious.
phoebe| well how would you know?! you didn't even read it!|the teacher| what do you think? you in the blue shirt.
phoebe| i think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.|the teacher| would ya care to venture one?
phoebe| would you care to venture one?|the teacher| are you just repeating what i'm saying?
phoebe| are you just repeating what i'm saying?|the teacher| all right, let's move on.
phoebe| okay then.|phoebe| yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
rachel| be-because i didn't want him to think i was stupid! i mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!|ross|  phoebe! 
phoebe| yeah?|ross| phoebe! you're note, amazing! not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. yeah, a guy called me mental! mental geller, yeah, i always wanted a cool nickname like that.
monica| yeah, the best you got in high school was wet pants geller.|ross| that was the water fountain! okay?! anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, i'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want.  hey tribbiani, give me that coffee! now!
cynthia| god, this was really fun! i've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.|joey| so you uh, still wondering?
cynthia| no, we just went out.|joey| you're smart. i like that.
cynthia| oh, candles! |joey| oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
cynthia| i can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date! |joey| hiya.
rachel| joey, is what she just said ummoh my god. |chandler| what is going on here?
rachel| and with chandler in the next room. what are you, what are you sick?|joey| i'm joey. i mean, i'm disgusting. i make low-budget adult films. 
joey| you guys promised you'd be more careful! i mean, come on! the good joey name is being dragged through the mud here!|monica| we're so sorry.
chandler| yeah.|joey| well, i'm telling everyone about you! that's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
chandler| no-no, wait! there's got to be a better explanation. you can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class.|joey| yeah, i like that. but no-no, how does that explain why rachel found my underwear at your place?
chandler| ohi don't know.|joey| well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
monica| okay, just wait, please. i promise we'll come up with something. just give us a little more time.|joey| all right. hey, but it better make me look really, really good.  oh, and another thing, the video camera? nice!!
dr. leedbetter| umm, ross. may i have a word with you?|ross| yeah, of course, donald.
dr. leedbetter| we've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.|ross| what?!
dr. leedbetter| threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.|ross|  yeah.
dr. leedbetter| we want you to speak to a psychiatrist. |ross| oh no, you-you don't understand. ugh, this is so silly. umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
dr. leedbetter|  a sandwich?|ross| yeah. you see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; i call it the moist maker. anyway, i-i put my sandwich in the fridge over here 
dr. leedbetter|  oh, you know what?|ross| what?
dr. leedbetter| i-i'm sorry. i, i-i-i believe i ate that.|ross| you ate my sandwich?
dr. leedbetter| it was a simple mistake. it could happen to anyone.|ross|  oh-oh really? did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a moist maker?
dr. leedbetter| no.|ross| do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
dr. leedbetter| there may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.|ross|  that said it was my sandwich?!
dr. leedbetter| now-now calm down. come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.|ross|  what?
dr. leedbetter| well, it was quite large. i-i-i-i-i had to throw most of it away.|ross| you-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
ross|  my sandwich?!!!|ross| my sandwich!!!!!! 
rachel| hi!|phoebe| hi!
rachel|  so umm, what's this book about?|phoebe| you didn't read this one either?!
rachel| well, i was gonna, but i accidentally read something else.|phoebe| what?
rachel| vogue! hey, so tell me about this jane eyre woman.|phoebe| no! you should've read it yourself!
rachel| come on phoebe! dont be such a goodie-goodie!|phoebe| fine! okay, all right, so jane eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. she's a cyborg. 
rachel| a cyborg?! isn't that like a robot?!|phoebe| yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
the teacher|  sorry i'm late. let's get started. so, what did everybody think about jane eyre?|phoebe| umm, rachel and i were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
the teacher| well, go ahead rachel.|rachel| uh, thank you phoebe. umm, well, what struck me most when reading jane eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
the teacher| if you're talking about feminism, i think you're right.|rachel| yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
chandler| hey.|monica| hey. okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, i thought that i would give you just a little preview. 
chandler|  you're naked in this picture!|monica| i know.
chandler| ross?|ross|  monica!
monica| ross, are you okay?|ross| i'm fine! i saw a psychiatrist at work today.
monica| why?!|ross| on account of my rage.
chandler| which i may say, right now, is out of control.|ross| he gave me a pill for it.
monica| a pill?|ross| uh-huh. well, when the psychiatrist told me i had to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. and i thought was a good idea so, i took it.
monica| wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?|chandler| and you're okay with that?
ross| i don't know. it's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but i, i definitely don't care about my sandwich.|rachel|  ugh, that was so embarrassing! i can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
phoebe|  i'm sorry. it was just so funny when you started comparing jane eyre to robocop. |rachel| that was not funny!
phoebe| well, i snapped! okay? you weren't taking the class seriously.|rachel| phoebe, come on! what is the big deal? i thought this was going to be something we could do together! y'know, i thought it would be fun!
phoebe| well, yeah! fun is good, but y'know i also wanted to learn. y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and i never went to high school.|rachel| ohh. oh, so you really wanted to learn. yeah, y'know, pheebs i just wanted to have fun. ohh, you know who you should go with?
monica|  i know! i know! i know!|the teacher| monica, you asked the question.
rachel|  oh my god! that's monica!!|joey| oh no-no-no! no-no-no-no-no-no-no!
rachel| you get away from me!! you sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!|ross|  what's going on?
rachel| joey has got a secret peephole!|chandler| 
rachel| yes! he has a naked picture of monica! he takes naked pictures of us! and then he eats chicken and looks at them!|rachel| look! 
ross| |monica|  give me that!
phoebe| all right, wait! just wait. everybody just calm down. okay? let's give our friend joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!|joey| no! i am not a pervert! okay? it's just i just kinda
chandler| all right, look! look. i think i can explain this.|joey| thank you!
chandler| joey's a sex addict. |joey| what?!!  no i'm not!!
monica| it's okay! it's good! it's good. it's a disease!|joey| no! no! i am not a sex addict!
monica| yes you are! that's the only way to explain all this stuff!|joey| no it isn't! no, it's not. because you can also explain it with the truth!
rachel| well, what is the truth?|ross| yeah, what's going on?
phoebe| what's going on?|joey|  i slept with monica.
chandler| well let's.let's see what everybody thinks of that?|monica| oh no!
ross| you slept with my sister?|joey| uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in london.
ross| this is not good for my rage. |rachel| monica, is this true?
joey| of course it's true! how else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?|monica| yes it's true.
rachel| okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?|joey| ahhoy! that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london. right monica?
monica| i guess i wanted to keep it  as a souvenir. |ross| my god monica!!
chandler| are you sure joe? are you sure you're not just a sex addict?|joey| no! if anyone's a sex addict here, it's monica! yeah. yeah. she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london!
phoebe| so that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.|joey| that makes sense!
rachel| and the video camera?|joey| uhh, monica?
monica| i guess i set up the video camera to try and entice joey.|joey| but sadly i could not be enticed.
ross| unbelievable! i mean you really kept joey's underwear?! why? why would you do that?!|monica| i'm monica. i'm disgusting. i stalk guys and keep their underpants.
joey| well, i think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. eh? all right, now, i'm going to get back to my bucket. i'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. |phoebe| i really thought you making a good point. i mean y'know, until you got cut off.
a female student| yeah, what's up with that girl monica?|phoebe| i don't know! i didn't come with her!

monica| come on, hurry!|joey| hey, how do you spell suspicious?

chandler| yes! chandler bing, 7! chandler bing, 0.|joey| you're driving me crazy with that!
chandler| okay, i'll stop.|joey| dont stop! move the bowl further away! ross could make that shot!

joey| chandler, i can't be playing games, ross is gonna be home soon. and i have to write five whole pages if i'm gonna stick to his schedule.|chandler| well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
joey|  all right! but uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?|chandler| i'm intrigued. 
joey| all right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. |chandler| okay, but be careful okay, because i wanna get our security deposit back.

joey| you're right, you're right, i'll get back to work.|ross|  now come on! 
joey| hey!|ross| no! ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! you can have this back when the five pages are done! 
danny| i had a really nice time tonight.|rachel| so did i. i'm really glad monica asked us out.

monica| no.|phoebe| does it look like an ashtray?
monica| no.|phoebe| does it look like a urinal?
monica| eww!! |ross| so pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
phoebe| well, yeah! but i'm not gonna take anymore crap. okay? no more mrs. nice bucket!|monica| yeah, good for you. y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
phoebe| yeah, i'm gonna go back to being street phoebe. yeah! oh but, y'know what? i can't go totally back because street phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. sorry. |rachel|  hey!
monica| hey!|rachel| hey, umm, can i ask you guys something?
monica and ross| sure.|rachel| uh, i don't have any brothers so i don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
ross| oh-oh, yeah.|monica| all the time. in fact, i was undefeated.
ross| uh, you weighted 200 pounds.|monica| still, i was quick as a cat.
rachel| well, i met danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.|monica| oh, you're kidding.
rachel| yeah, they were very y'knowwrestley. but, i guess that's normal?|monica|  we don't, we don't wrestle now.
ross| yeah, not since i got too strong for you.|monica| too strong for me?
ross| yeah.|monica| you wanna go right now? 'cause i'll take you right now, buddy! you wanna go?
ross| oh fine.|monica| ready? 
rachel| okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. that helps a lot. thanks. |chandler|  guys, come on! let's go! the puck drops in 20 minutes! come on, joe!
ross| joey's not going.|joey|  i didn't finish my five pages.
chandler| well, why can't you do them tomorrow?|ross| because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
joey| yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.|chandler|  why don't you cut him a little slack? okay? maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
ross| i think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and fireball.|joey| dude, if you think fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
chandler| the only reason you're doing this to joey is because you're bored. okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.|ross| i am not unemployed. i'm on sabbatical!
joey| come on look guys, don't fight.|ross| and the reason i'm doing this is because i am joey's friend. and if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
chandler| oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?|ross| if it does? then you're an amazing friend of mine.
joey| hey-hey guys, hey! how about we settle this over a friendly game of fireball? huh? i'll go unhook the smoke detectors!|ross| how about we settle this right now!  there! now, no one's going to the game. ha-ha-ha!
chandler| i paid for those tickets!|ross| no you didn't. you said you would, but you never did!
chandler| oh yeah! |danny| so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!
joey| oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.|chandler| when did that happen to you?!
joey| don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picturei didn't have my camera!|chandler| oh yeah. first off all, chasing the churo guy isn't jogging.
krista| oh, this is so good |danny| oh, damn! i got it on my pants.
krista| here, i'll get it. |krista| we'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
danny| yep.  i'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.|rachel| oh, great!
chandler| okay, bye!  oh my god!!|monica| that was unbelievable! 
rachel| okay, see? i told you!|joey| yeah, wow, sorry rach.
chandler| i don't believe they're brother and sister.|joey| they're brother and sister!!!
phoebe| oh whoa-whoa-whoa! wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. |phoebe| whoa-whoa-whoa! no drinks near the bucket! set it down over there and then you can make a contribution!  i thought i told you to get outta here!
bob| uh, phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.|phoebe| what?!
bob| umm, ginger's gonna take over this corner.|phoebe| that chick can't handle my corner.
bob| look, either you leave, or we remove you.|phoebe| fine. 
danny| oh, hey rach! i thought we said seven?|rachel| yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
danny| what?! why?!|rachel| umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and
danny| oh great! that special bond again! why do women have such a problem with the fact that i'm close with my sister?|rachel| well, okay, look. i don't know, listen, i don't know what's going on here but let's
danny| do-do you, do you have brothers?|rachel| no, i have two sisters. but one of them has a very masculine energy.
danny| are you close with them?|rachel| no-no, they're not very nice people.
danny| okay, listen, i really like you. okay? i think this can go somewhere. so what if i'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?|rachel| well, uh, i-i don't know. see when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of
krista|  danny! hurry up! the bath is getting cold!|danny|  what?
rachel| yeah, okay, i'll see you later. |chandler| oh hey! there's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
ross| hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, gonna need stitches ball.|joey|  hey guys! i was at the library all morning and i already finished my five pages for today!
ross| yay!|chandler| great! now, we can go to the ranger game!  last night!
joey| no dude, ross tore up the tickets!|ross| i guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. huh?
chandler| yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck all the live long day!!|joey| yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that i finished it. and uh, i think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if i could hear it. so would you guys read it for me?
chandler| all right. |ross| all right. 
joey| okay. |ross| hey man.
chandler| what is up?|ross| about yesterday, i was really wrong. i am sorry.
chandler| no, it was me. i'm sorry. i over reacted.|ross| maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest  but we had our best friend's interest at heart.
chandler| could i be more sorry. |ross| i don't know, i'm one sorry polentologist.  i'm sorry.
chandler|  i'm sorry too.|joey| oh no! no-no, keep reading! the good part's coming up. keep going.
ross|  i am sorry, chandler.|chandler| i am sorry, ross.

monica| hi, how are you doing kelly?|rachel| i'm doing just fine! god, tiffany, you smell so great!
monica| it's my new perfume. why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?|rachel| oh, y'know joey, you are sick!

joey| what's the matter?!|chandler| we wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know

ross|  73! 72! 71!|joey| ross! ross! ross, listen! who are you kissing at midnight, huh? rachel or phoebe?
ross| what?|joey| well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
ross| well, who's gonna kiss my sister.|joey| chandler.
ross| awww, man! really?|joey| dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or chandler?
ross| that's a good point.|joey| yeah.
ross| oh well, since i have that whole history with rachel, i guess phoebe.|joey| okay, great!
ross| all right.|joey| pheebs! pheebs! ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
phoebe| it's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?|joey| rach! rach! listen, i'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
rachel| what?!|ross| well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. you can't kiss ross you got the history.
rachel| so?|joey| so? who would you rather have kiss you, me or chandler?
rachel| oh, good point.|joey| yeah!
all|  3! 2! 1! happy new year!!|chandler|  happy new year!
monica| happy new year.|ross|  happy new year, pheebs!
phoebe| you too!|rachel|  happy new year, joey!
joey| so did that do anything for ya?|ross| y'know what? i'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
rachel| but your divorce isn't even final yet.|ross| just the one divorce in '99! y'know what, i am gonna be happy this year. i am gonna make myself happy.
chandler| do you want us to leave the room, or?|ross| everyday i am gonna do one thing that i haven't done before. that my friends is my new year's resolution.
phoebe| ooh! that's a good one! mine is to pilot a commercial jet.|chandler| that's good one too, pheebs. now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
phoebe| maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to europe for free on their own plane.|monica| she has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
ross| in fact, i'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. eh, y'know what, better yet? a week.|chandler| i'll take that bet my friend. and you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the \new thing you do that day!\  and it starts right now!
joey| all right, my new year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.|ross| ohh.
phoebe| really?! how come?|joey| well, y'know those special skills i have listed on my resume? i would love it would be great if one of those was true.
phoebe| do you want me to teach you? i'm a great teacher.|joey| really? who-who have you taught?
phoebe| well, i taught me and i love me.|joey| yeah that'd be great! thanks pheebs!
rachel| op, look! claire forgot her glasses! and she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, i hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what i'm talking about.|monica| hey rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
rachel| i don't gossip!|rachel| well, maybe sometimes i find out things or i hear something and i pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean i'm a gossip. i mean, would you call ted kopel a gossip?
monica| well if ted kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, i would.|rachel| what? they were like this! 
woman| i'll see you tomorrow.|ross| okay!  hey!
chandler and joey| hey!|ross| i just asked that girl out.
chandler| nice!|joey| nice!! yeah! is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
ross| yes it is. see. |chandler|  elizabeth hornswoggle?
ross| that's right, uh, elizabeth hornswoggle.|chandler| horn-swoggle.
joey| you all right chandler? is there something funny about that name?|chandler| no. no, i just think that maybe i-i'd heard it somewhere before. 
joey| oh really! where? somewhere funny i'd bet! |ross| hi, pheebs!
phoebe| hey! |ross| oh-oh, guess what? i-i have a date with elizabeth  hornswoggle.
phoebe| hornswoggle?  ooh, this must be killing you.|ross| all right, see you later.

joey| umm, okay.|phoebe| okay, lesson one: chords. now, i don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, i-i-i made up names for the way my hand looks while i'm doing them. 
chandler| what an interesting approach to guitar instruction. y'know some might find it amusing, i myself find it regular.|phoebe| hey everybody, rachel was so good today. she didn't gossip at all.
rachel| i didnt! even when i found outumm, all right, well let's just say i found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. |joey| hey, pheebs! check-check this out. 
phoebe| ooh, you nailed the old lady! |joey| yeah listen so, i thought i was getting better, so on my way home today i stopped by this guitar store and
phoebe| did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? did you?!|joey| no.
phoebe| give me your hands.  pick. do you want to learn to play guitar?|joey| yes!
phoebe| then don't touch one!!|ross|  hi!

ben| auntie monica!! |chandler|  someone comment on the pants!
rachel| i think they're very nice.|monica| i like 'em.
joey| yeah! |monica| i like them a lot.
chandler| that's not what i had in mind! see, people like ross don't generally wear these types of pants. you see, they're very tight.  maybe there's something in that area.|ross| oh see, i-i needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and i thought to myself, \wow,  i never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before.\
chandler| oh come on!! |ross|  okay, seriously, what do you think?
joey| you look like a freak.|rachel| awful, absolutely awful. 
ross| what are you, what are you doing?|monica| it's my new year's resolution!

joey| well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. |ross|  are you hot? 
elizabeth hornswoggle| no.|ross| okay, it must just be me then.
ross| that was just the pants on the couch. umm, hey, do you, do you mind if i use your bathroom?|elizabeth| no, go ahead.
ross| thanks. |ross|  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

joey|  g-sharp.|phoebe| g-sharp? have you been studying the real names of the chords?  oh my god! 
joey| what?! i didn't touch a guitar!|phoebe| no, but you're questioning my method!
joey| no, i'm not questioning it, i'm saying it's stupid! |monica| thank you. 
phoebe| y'know none of my other student thought i was stupid.|joey| your other student, was you!
phoebe| yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!|joey| 
phoebe| fine! you go learn from your qualified instructor! but don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play bad, bad leroy brown!!|rachel|  \baddest man in the whole damn town.\
phoebe| oh, fine! take his side! |monica|  i can't wait to be with you! i'll sneak over as soon as ross picks up ben. i'll just tell rachel i'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
chandler| |monica|  awww, y'know what your nickname is, mr. big
rachel| arghh!! |joey|  hello?
ross|  joey, it's ross! i need some help!|joey| uhh, chandler's not here.
ross| well, you can help me!|joey| okay.
ross| listen, i'm in elizabeth's bathroom|joey| nice!
ross| no, i-i got really hot in my leather pants so i took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. look, i-i can't put them back on. i can't!|joey| oh. that is quite a situation. uh, do you see any like, powder?
ross| powder! yeah! yeah, i have powder!  |joey| good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
ross| yeah, okay, hold on!  they're not coming on man.|joey| umm, do you see anyoh, vaseline? 
ross| ohh, i-i see lotion, i have lotion! will that work?|joey| yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
ross| hold on.|joey| ross? you okay?
ross| they're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!|joey| really?! uhh, what color is it?
ross| what difference does that make?!|joey| well, i'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
rachel|  joey, do you have a minute?|ross| dude, what am i gonna

joey| oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. i am putting out fires all over the place.|rachel| okay. okay. okay. joey, i have got to tell you something!
joey| what-what is it, what is it?|rachel| oh my god, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
joey| oh no, no-no-no-no! i don't want to know!|rachel| yes! yes! yes, you do want to know! this is unbelievable!
joey| i don't care, rach! look, i am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!|rachel| what? what secrets? you know secrets? what are they?
joey| and you're not supposed to be gossiping!! |rachel| i know, i know! i just can't keep this one in, so i pick up the phone 
joey| i'm not listening to you!|elizabeth| ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. i'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
ross| all right, i'm coming out. hey, can you turn the lights off.|elizabeth| no, let's just leave the lights on.
elizabeth| oh my god!|ross| i had a problem.
joey| hey, pheebs?|phoebe| no, i can't talk to you! i don't have a fancy ad in the yellow pages!
joey| look, pheebs, i just, i wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. and-and i promise, i won't touch a guitar until you say i'm ready.  you really think i'm ready?|phoebe| uh-huh!
joey| wow! cool! |joey|  was the chord at least right
phoebe| no!|chandler| oh my god!

rachel| hey, uh, joey?|joey| umm?
rachel| remember that big thing i was gonna tell you about?|joey| oh, no!

ross|  hey.|joey| whoa, dude, look out! you almost crushed my hat! 
ross| sorry.|chandler| 
ross|  this would be the place where you explain the hat.|joey| oh! yeah, look there's this play all right? and i'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. a real clothes horse. so i figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
chandler| and you're gonna make them all disappear.|joey| yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
chandler| done.|rachel| joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? i'll help you out.

rachel| okay now joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?|joey| all right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.

phoebe| all right, i'd better go too. i have to go talk to my dad.|rachel| ooh, pheebs, what are you gonna say? are you gonna tell him who you are?

monica| well, at least you scared someone.|phoebe| y'know it's funny, you'd think i'd be angry. i mean, you'd think i'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. fortunately, i'm past it.

phoebe| y'know what, it doesnt matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.|frank sr.| all right. well, y'know in my defense i was a lousy father.
phoebe| that's a defense?|frank sr.| yes. yes it is. i burned the formula and i put your diapers on backwards. i mean, i made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
phoebe| you make up songs?|frank sr.| well no, just-just that one. but, it was stupid. let's see, how did it, how did it go. umm.  
frank sr.| i just, i y'know, i'm not very good at this. so, umm |phoebe| well, i am.

rachel| i just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.|joey| i can't believe i'm hearing this!
rachel| wait a minute! wait a minute! i'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, i justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.|chandler| yeah umm, they're called wallets.
phoebe|  oh hey, you guys, look! ugly naked guy is putting stuff in boxes!|rachel| i'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
ross| ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.|rachel| ohh, i'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
chandler| and we're done with the chicken fried rice.|ross| hey! hey! if he's moving, maybe i should try to get his place!
all| good idea! yes!|ross| it would be so cool to live across from you guys!
joey| hey, yeah! then we could do that telephone thing! y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!|chandler| or we can do the actual telephone thing.
ross| oh my god! i love this apartment! isn't it perfect?! i can't believe i never realized how great it is!|rachel| well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
phoebe| it's amazing! you better hurry up and fill out an application or i'm gonna beat you to it.|ross|

rachel| no. joey, she knows! we were at ugly naked guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window.  actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.|phoebe| okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that rachel knows?
joey| yes, but y'know what? it doesn't matter who knows what. now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!|phoebe| or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
rachel| wh-what do you mean?|phoebe| well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
rachel| ohhh, i-i would enjoy that!|joey| no-no-no! no-no wait rach, you know what would even be more fun? telling them.
rachel| ehhh, no, i wanna do phoebe's thing.|joey| i can't take any
phoebe| no! you don't have to do anything! just don't tell them that we know!|joey| noo! i can't take any more secrets!  i've got your secrets. i've got their secrets. i got secrets of my own y'know!
rachel| you don't have any secrets!|joey| oh yeah? well, you don't know about hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. 
rachel|  so umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?|joey| ugh.
phoebe| well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.|rachel| okay.
phoebe| and then. i would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. my sexuality.|chandler|  hello children!

chandler| phoebe, it's me. you can tell me anything.|phoebe| well actually you're the one person i can't tell this too. and the one person i want to the most.
chandler| what's going on?|phoebe| i think it's just y'know that i haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just dont even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffeeoh no, have i said to much? well it's just something to think about. i know i will.
monica| you are so cute! how did you get to be so cute?|chandler| well, my grandfather was swedish and my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
monica| okay, now you're even cuter!!|chandler| y'know that is a popular opinion today i must say.
monica| what?|chandler| the weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, i think, i think phoebe was hitting on me.
monica| what are you talking about?|chandler| i'm telling you i think phoebe thinks i'm foxy.
monica| that's not possible!|chandler| ow!
monica| i'm sorry it's just, phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.|chandler| oh, y'know i-i can't hear that enough.
monica| i'm sorry, i think that you just misunderstood her.|chandler| no, i didn't misunderstand, okay? she was all over me! she touched my bicep for crying out loud!
monica| this bicep?|chandler| well it's not flexed right now!
rachel| hey mon, what are you doing now? wanna come see a movie with us?|monica| uhh, y'know actually i was gonna do some laundry.
rachel| oh.|monica| hey chandler, wanna do it with me?
chandler| sure, i'll do it with ya.|monica| okay.
rachel| okay great, hold on a sec!  oh, here you go! you don't mind do ya? that would really help me out a lot! thanks!|monica| i mean i-i don't i think i have enough quarters.
phoebe| i have quarters! |ross|  hey!
rachel| hey ross! any word on the apartment yet?|ross| well, i called over there and it turns out ugly naked guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
rachel| oh.|ross| no-no, i got the edge. i know it's not exactly ethical but i sent him a little bribe to 
monica| oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?|ross| no.
chandler| that new mountain bike?|ross| no.
monica| well what did you send?|ross| a basket of mini-muffins.
phoebe| but there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. which one did you send?|ross| the small one.
rachel| what?! you-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?|ross| well yeah! someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. it was the best day.
chandler| your work makes me sad.|ross| oh man! i want that place so much!! i was so sure that was gonna work! there's twelve bucks i'll never see again! 
rachel| all right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|monica| bye!
all| bye!|phoebe| bye chandler! 
chandler|  okay, did you see that?! with the inappropriate and the pinching!!|monica| actually, i did!
chandler| okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?|monica| ohhh, oh my god! oh my god! she knows about us!
chandler| are you serious?|monica| phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! that's the only explanation for it!
chandler|  okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsshe knows!|chandler|  joey!
joey| yeah?|chandler| phoebe knows about us!
joey| well i didn't tell them!|monica| them?! who's them?
joey| uhhh, phoebe and joey.|monica| joey!
joey| and rachel. i would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!|chandler| oh man!
joey| i'm sorry! but hey, it's over now, right? because you can tell them that you know they know and i can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!|monica| unless
joey| no! not unless! look this must end now!|monica| oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! but see they don't know that we know that they know! so
chandler| ahh yes, the messers become the messies!|ross| noooo.
rachel| oh ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!|phoebe| yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
ross| look i've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!|rachel| y'know what you should do?
ross| huh?|rachel| you should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. yeah! like if i would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. or uh, or my underwear.
joey| i'm listening.|rachel|  see?
ross| that is a great idea! and! i know ugly naked guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.|phoebe| he broke that.
ross| well, he had gravity boots.|rachel| yeah, he broke those too.
joey| so he likes to break stuff.|ross| okay, i've got to go pick up ben but i-i will figure something out.  hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
phoebe| i wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.|joey| yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
ross| right. |rachel| hello!  it's chandler.
phoebe|  hello you.|chandler| hello phoebe, i've been thinking about you all day.

phoebe| really?|chandler| yeah, listen, joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and i'll let you uh, feel my bicep. or maybe more.
phoebe| i'll have to get back to you on that. okay, bye!  oh my god! he wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!|rachel| are you kidding?!

guy| hi!|ross| hi!
guy| welcome to the building. i'm uh, steve sarah; i'm president of the tenants committee.|ross| oh hi! ross geller. and this is my friend phoebe.
steve| oh hi phoebe.|phoebe| mr. president.
steve| i came to talk to you about howard.|ross| howard?
steve| yeah, he's the handy man. he's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.|ross| oh that's nice.
steve| yeah. so, do you want to give a check? or|ross| oh. uhh
steve| oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! you can slip it under my door. |ross| no-no, it's not that, it's just i-i just moved in.
steve| well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.|ross| yes, but i've lived here for 25 minutes.
steve| oh, okay, i get it. |ross| no wait, look. look! i'm sorry, it's just i've never even met howard. i-i mean i don't know howard.
steve| howard's the handy man!|ross| yes but too me he's just, man.
steve| okay, fine, whatever. welcome to the building. |ross|  ugh, can you believe that guy!
phoebe| yeah. i really like his glasses.|ross| so then president steve told everyone that i was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! a little kid spit on my knee! y'know what i'm gonna do? i'm gonna throw a party. that's right. for everyone in the building, and i'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, i am not a bad guy. i am not a cheap guy! i'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. a man with principles.
chandler|  sounds like a fun party.|rachel| hmm. look, ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? the party's gonna cost you way more than that.
ross| it doesn't matter! it's my principles! we're talking about my principles!|rachel| okay, i thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
ross| oh, they'll like me. once they come to my awesome par-tay! okay, i gotta run. i gotta go get some nametags. |rachel| and that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
chandler| very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of monica. i don't want you putting any ideas in her head.|rachel| umm, chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica's head.
chandler| wh-wh-why?!|rachel| well, because she loves you and because you love her.
chandler| yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!|rachel| hey, chandler, don't freak out! i'm telling you something you already know! come on, she broke up with richard because he didn't want to have babies. and she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's monica.
chandler| i don't see it that way. okay? because, i see two monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new monica, who i just started to date. now, who's to say what she wants?! im right. i'm right. am i right?|rachel| no, you're right, you are absolutely right. i mean that makes, that makes everything different.
chandler| okay. it's not different at all, is it?|rachel| not unless different means the same.
katie| you were so funny with that waiter! you're such a nut! |joey|  y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
katie| no, you make them funny. you're the funny one! |joey| uhh, look katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. okay? umm, look i like you. i-i really do, i like you a lot. okay? but sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
katie| aww, like i could hurt you. are you making fun of my size? don't make fun of me because of my size! |monica| isn't this great?
chandler| hmm.|monica| couldn't you just stay like this forever?  chandler! couldn't you just stay here forever?
chandler| yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. |monica| are you okay?
chandler| yeah, i'm cool. casual.|monica| what-what are you doing?
chandler| i'm just hanging out. y'know, having fun. y'know with the girl that i'm seeing casually.|monica| man, i knew it! i knew you were going to do this!!
chandler| what?!|monica| get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
chandler| well, you do want all that stuff, right?|monica| oh and you know what i want!
chandler| yes! you want babies! you have baby fever!|monica| i do not have baby fever!
chandler| oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! i've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!|monica| have you lost your mind? chandler, this isn't about me! this is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
chandler| nah-uh! i know you! okay? i know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!|monica| you don't know everything. did you know that i'm going out with rachel tonight instead of you? hmm? and did you know that the only baby around here is you?! and did you know that i can't even look at you right now?! 
chandler| well, i did not know that.|chandler| it's gonna be okay, right? i mean she's not gonna leave me? this is, this is fixable.
ross and joey| oh yeah, yeah, sure. absolutely.|chandler| by me?
ross| oh, no!|joey| no-no.
ross| well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.|joey| yeah, big!
joey| uh-oh, shht! the misses.|monica| gunther, can i get a coffee  to go?
chandler| monica. |monica| i'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
chandler| just tell me what i need to do to make things right.|monica| what?!
chandler| well, that's what we do. y'know, i-i mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then i do and then y'know you think i'm all cute again.|monica| really? i'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. you're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. all right? y'know what? if you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one. 
party guests|  howard! howard! howard! howard! howard! howard! howard! howard! howard! yay!!|ross| phoebe! 
phoebe| oh, hi ross!|ross| what are you doing?
phoebe| oh, i thought this was your party and it turns out its a party for howard. he's just the sweetest little man! |ross| you chipped in?!

phoebe| no! no! i'm talking you up to people. just give it a little time, all right? relax, get something to eat! okay?|ross| so uh, what did you tell them about me?
phoebe| oh, i was telling them about you and emily. y'know, try to get some sympathy.|ross| ohh. 
phoebe| but somehow you came off as the bad guy.|ross| what?!
phoebe| yeah, i think i told it wrong. y'know, we should talk about that because i don't totally understand what happened there.|ross|  ohh, this cake is really good!
phoebe| oh, okay, see? things are looking up already!|steve| 3-b!
all| oh yeah, aww!|steve| okay, you got your free food! you ruined everyone's fun! don't you think it's time you went home?!
all| yeah, get out! now!|steve| go back to 3-b, 3-b!
phoebe| all right, everyone calm down! everyone calm down! i have something that i would like to say! who here likes ross?  cradle robbing perv! so, i think you all know what i mean.|phoebe| obviously i didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. i just thought if i kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
ross| oh wow, yeah! see, i did not get that.|chandler| where's monica?! where is she? i need to talk to her! it's urgent! is she here?
monica|  i'm monica.|chandler| i need to talk to you, it's urgent!
monica| okay.|chandler| okay, i've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. and uh, well i guess there's only one-one way to do this. 
monica| wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!|chandler|  monica
monica| no-no, don't-don't-don't do it!|chandler| will you marry me?
ross| oh-no. no. no.|joey| what a bad idea!
rachel| ohhhh, i cannot look at it! |monica| chandler, why are you doing this?
chandler| i don't know. but i know i'm not afraid to do this.|monica| chandler.
chandler| i'm doing this because i'm sorry?|monica| do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
chandler| no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.  will you be my wife?|monica|  chandler, umm, i want you to take just a minute and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
chandler| yeah, i'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.|monica| honey! do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! i mean i never said i wanted to have babies and get married right now!
chandler| yeah i know, but i was really confused and then i talked to these guys. |monica| who? two divorces and joey?!
ross| hey!|joey| she's right y'know.
ross| yeah, but still, cheap shot!|monica| y'know what? y'know when i said that i want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? well, you're not ready for that.
chandler| i didn't think i was!|monica| oh my god, what would have done if i said yes?
chandler| well i would've been happy because i would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that i love. or, you would've seen a chandler shaped hole in that door. |joey| hey ross, will you pass me that knife?
ross| no, i will not!|joey| oh, it's okay. you don't have to be so mean about it.
ross| you're right, i'm sorry. will you marry me?|phoebe| aw, and i was gonna ask you to marry me because i forgot to say hello to you last week.
rachel| oh no wait pheebs, i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. but i'm not sure, chandler?|chandler| okay, how long is this going to go on.
monica| well i think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.|ross| this is fun. hey rach, remember that whole \we were on a break thing?\ well, i'm sorry, will you marry me? 
chandler| that's not funny.|joey| that's not funny at all!
joey| hey!|chandler| hey!
monica| hey!|joey| what are you guys doing up?
chandler| oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?|joey|  dark red.
chandler| yeah, i think that's wrong, but there's a connect the dots in here for you later.  hey, how about maroon?|monica| 
joey| aww, you guys are so cute!|monica| i know.
joey| all right, i'll see you in the morning.|chandler and monica| okay.
dream monica| y'know, i love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!|dream joey| aww, me too. now let's finish this and go to bed.
dream monica| okay! there's only one left, three letter word, not dog but|dream joey| cat.
dream monica| yes! you are so smart!  i love you.|dream joey| i love you too.
rachel|  uhh, we still need a tip.|phoebe| all right. hold on.  how much more do we need?
rachel| a couple of bucks.|phoebe| okay, dime!  oh my god, this is a police badge!
monica| wow!|chandler| oh that's so cool! why would a cop come in here though? they don't serve donuts.  y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? i think i can come up with something better than that.
rachel| phoebe, i bet somebody's missing that badge.|phoebe| yeah, i should probably take it back. ooh, but you know what? while i'm at the police station, i could check their ten most wanted lists because my friend fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! 
joey|  hey, you guys!|chandler| hey!
rachel| hey joey!|monica| hey.
joey|  hey. that uh, that my sweatshirt?|monica| oh yes, it is. i'm sorry i borrowed it, i was cold. i hope its okay?
joey| well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and im not him.|monica| i'm sorry, i'll give it back to you.
joey| no-no! no! i mean it's gonna be all smelling like monica!|monica| are you saying i smell bad?
joey| no! no, you smell like a meadow. |monica| what's with him?
chandler| oh, y'know what? the last time joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.|rachel|  ugh!

rachel| ross!! oh my--ugh!! you kept count?! you are such a loser!|ross| a loser you did it with  298 times!
phoebe| oh. oh! ma'am? excuse me, ma'am? |the smoking woman| yes?

phoebe| no but you shouldn't! don't ever do that again.|the smoking woman| i won't!  until i have my next cigarette.

phoebe| save it red! unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.|the smoking woman| i am not going to apologize to a tree!
phoebe| you apologize to the tree right now or i am calling for backup.  backup! backup!!|the smoking woman| i-i'm sorry! sorry.
phoebe| okay, cancel backup! cancel backup!|ross| okay.

ross| good-good-good. |rachel| oh-oh! 
ross| yeah, you got it right? you got it right? you got it? |rachel| any chance you think the couch looks good there?
phoebe| so this guy was all  it was just so cool!|monica|  phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
phoebe| i know but i'm having so much fun doing good deeds.|chandler| okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. you could get arrested.
phoebe| you could get arrested, right now! |phoebe|  hey.
joey|  oh.|chandler| hi, joe.
joey| yeah, i didnt know you guys were going to be here.|monica| hey joey, sweetie, taste this. 
joey|  what?! why?!|monica| what is going on with you?
joey| nothing!|chandler| oh, come on! you've been acting strange all day!
joey| all right! there is something. i kinda had a dream, |chandler| whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if martin luther king had said that?  i kinda have a dream! i dont want to talk about it.
joey| well, it involved monica.|chandler| you had a dream about a girl that i am seeing?! oh, that is so cool! 
joey| don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. i haven't dreamt about her like that since i found out about you two--ish. |monica| what was the dream about?
joey| well, okay. you were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. y'know like you guys were doing last night. so, that's it. i'm in love with monica and i'll be moving out.|monica| wait, joey! joey! that doesnt mean that-that you're in love with me!
joey| it-it doesnt?|monica| no!
chandler| no, it can mean anything. like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because i've become the apartment stud.|joey| that kinda sounds like your dream dude.
monica| or, it could mean that-that you saw chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.|joey| in the dream i did enjoy the closeness.
monica| um-hmm.|chandler| joey, look, are you attracted to monica? right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
joey|  not really.|chandler| well there you have it!
monica| well sure! i'm just wearing sweats!  but that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!|joey| no, i don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. y'know? i mean, yeah, i can get a girlfriend! yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
chandler| well y'know, monica and i were friends before we started dating. so maybe-maybe that's it?|joey| friends first? that's interesting.
monica| you become friends after?|joey| no, never done that either.
rachel|  hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?|chandler| oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
monica|  that's right.|rachel|  what's up joey?
joey|  how you doin'?|phoebe| excuse me, is this your car?
guy| yeah.|phoebe| well i don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance. 
guy| don't worry about it. it's not a problem.|phoebe| well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause i'm a cop. 
guy|  so am i!|phoebe| ohh, no. 
cop|  hey, wait a second! so wait, what precinct are you with?|phoebe| i-i'm with the umm, the 57th.
cop| oh, i know a guy in homicide up there.|phoebe| i'm in vice. yeah, in fact i'm undercover right now. i'm a whore.
cop| who-who else is in vice up there?|phoebe| umm, do you know, umm sipowicz?
cop| sipowicz? no, i don't think so.|phoebe| yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
cop| no, i don't know him.|phoebe|  dont try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. his umm, his partner just died.
cop| wow umm, tell sipowicz i'm real sorry for his loss.|phoebe| i-i sure will, take care. 
cop|  and where did you find my badge?|phoebe| oh. 
rachel| hey! joey, would you mind giving me and ross a hand moving his couch?|joey| oh, i'd love too, but i got acting class. but y'know what? i guess i can blow that off,  for you.
rachel| thanks!|joey| uh, hey, rach let me ask you something. uh, i was just over there talking to monica and chandler, boy they are really tight.
rachel| i know.|joey| yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. i'm thinking of getting me one of those.
rachel| what's up joe?|joey| well, the reason i think monica and chandler are so great
rachel| yeah?|joey| is because they were friends first. y'know? so i asked myself, \who are my friends?\ you and phoebe, and i saw you first. so
rachel|  what are you saying?|joey| i'm saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch.
rachel| y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as i am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, i just, i-i don't think we should be cranking anything up.|joey| i'll treat you real nice. 
rachel|  yeah, well, y'know umm no honey, listen i think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but i think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. don't hit on your existing friends!|joey| won't-won't that take longer?
rachel| yeah. yeah. oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.|joey| yeah. i understand. i understand.  man, i wish i saw phoebe first!
ross| come here to me. no-no, you come here to me.|rachel|  hey ross! i brought reinforcements.
ross| oh great! what, you brought joey?|rachel| well, i brought the next best thing.
chandler|  hey!|ross| chandler?! you brought chandler?! the next best thing would be monica!
chandler| y'know, i would be offended, but monica is freakishly strong, so|ross| look, i-i drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it.  
rachel| whoa-oh, what's-what's that? |ross| oh, that's me.
rachel| wow! you certainly think a lot of yourself.|ross| no! that's-that's my arm!
chandler|  oh, i see. i thought you just really, really liked your new couch.|ross| y'know what? just-just follow my lead. 
rachel| okay!|chandler| okay.
ross| come on, chandler. |ross| all right.  okay, here we go!
ross| all right, ready?|chandler| yeah.
ross| turn.|chandler|  okay.
ross| turn! turn!|chandler| okay, i don't think we can turn anymore!
rachel| ross, i don't, i just don't think it's going to fit.|ross| oh yeah it will! come on, up! up-up-up! up! yes! here we go! pivot!  pivot! piv-ot! piv-et!! piv-ett!!! piv-et!
chandler| shut up! shut up! shut up!!|ross| okay, i don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
chandler and rachel| you think?!|ross| all right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
chandler| okay, yeah, i think it's really stuck now.|ross| i can't believe that didn't work!
rachel| i know, me neither! i mean, you had a sketch!|chandler| oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
joey|  hey!|rachel| hey! how's it going? did you make any new friends?
joey| yeah, yeah, i met this woman. |chandler|  hey, whoa-whoa! what's she like?
joey| uhh, well, she'sreally good in bed.|monica| joey, i thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
joey|  well look, hey, it's all your fault!|rachel| what?! why?!
joey| well because you didn't give me advice! no! you gave me a pickup line! as soon as i told her i wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. i suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!  and her roommate!|monica| what about the closeness?
joey| closeness-shmoshness! there was three of us for crying out loud!|joey|  all right! hey, who wants pizza?!
chandler| ooh, i do! i do! i do!|joey|  oh, great! can you believe i found it on the second floor? 
monica| who is it?|voice| n.y.p.d!!
phoebe and joey| oh my god!|joey| uhh, just a minute officer!! 
cop| i'm looking for phoebe buffay!|phoebe| ooh, god, it's him! it's that cop! god, i can't believe it! he found me!
rachel| oh my god, phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!|phoebe| well, if i'm going down, i'm taking you  okay, you can arrest me. fine. but you'll never make it stick and you know it!
cop| yeah, but i kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. i mean, you understand right?|phoebe| yep! as long as you understand that i'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. a fool!
cop| i don't like looking foolish. y'know what? maybe uh, i don't arrest you today. maybe i came by and you weren't here.|phoebe| i would love it if i weren't here!
cop| okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight i was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?|phoebe| me?!
cop| yeah. ever since you flashed my badge at me, i kinda can't stop thinking about you. you're the prettiest, fake undercover whore i've ever seen.|chandler and joey| nice!
phoebe| wow! i didn't see that coming! you're-you're asking me out!|cop| yeah. i mean, i coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
phoebe| umm, yeah, i'd like to go out with you officer|cop| gary.
phoebe| gary.|gary| okay, so it's a date.
phoebe| yeah! so--ooh, i gotta ask you though. how did you know where to find me?|gary| well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so i just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so i just checked it out.
phoebe| ohh, impressive.|gary| not as impressive as you. i gotta tell you, i looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
phoebe| yeah, we'll talk at dinner.|gary| okay.  so i'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
phoebe| all right, i can't wait!|gary| okay. and don't worry, i'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
chandler|  he has a gun!|ross| i'd like to return this couch. i'm not satisfied with it.
the saleswoman| you wanna return this couch?  it's cut in half!|ross| that's what i'm telling you.
the saleswoman| did you cut this couch in half?|ross| this couch, is cut in half! i would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
the saleswoman| you're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!|ross| look, i am a reasonable man. i will accept store credit.
the saleswoman| i'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.|ross|  i take it.

monica| what are you doing?|phoebe| well, same thing we did all day, hang out at gary's apartment. he is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. but have fun at the movie.
monica|  oh, we're not seeing a movie!|phoebe| you're not? then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
monica| oh umm, that's because i just wanted to y'know walk in on me and chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. will you excuse me for just a second?|phoebe| yeah!
monica| okay.  chandler? can i see you for a second?|chandler| uh, yeah.
monica| okay.  we have got to beat them! {here we go yet again.}|chandler| why?
monica| 'cause, gary and phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!|chandler| ohh, so?
monica| so! so we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!|chandler| monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! okay? it's crazy. {finally! the voice of reason.} i mean, just impress gary and phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and i'm saying no to this, why? get your coat.
ross|  hey!|the man|  you should check this out, tell the other tenants. apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
ross|  who isn't? |ross| i don't, i don't think we've meet. i-i'm ross.
the hot girl| i know. you're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.|ross| nevermind! 
the hot girl| no, i-i actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. i mean you had just moved in.|ross| i had just moved in. thank you! listen umm
the hot girl| jen.|ross| jen, i know this may sound a little but uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or
jen| sure! that would be nice.|ross| umm?
jen| oh! my number is on there.  give me a call.|ross| i will give you a call.
jen| i'll see you later. |ross| okay!
jen| i forgot my paper. |chandler| that was amazing!
monica| phoebe and gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.|chandler| that was amazing.
monica| we are the hottest! huh? no one is hotter than we are! you're the best.|chandler| no, you're the best.
monica| no, you're the best.|chandler| no, you're the best.
monica| i am the best.|joey| 
monica|  hey joey! isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?|joey| i don't know. but i can see through your sheet.  yeah, yeah, that's her. but y'know what? doesn't matter, i'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
monica| why?|joey| because it's impossible to find her apartment! she lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
monica| what are you talking about?  she obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!|joey| no. no. no. she lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
monica| no, those first two windows,  that's the lobby. and y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. you've been counting wrong.|joey| i did not know that! thank you monica.  i can't believe i almost lost another girl because of counting.
ross| so uhh, you ready?|jen| sure, i'll just get my coat.  could you get that?
ross| sure.  joey|joey| dahhhhh!! 
rachel| ah, first, i-i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.|mr. zelner| that's quite all right, but i feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
rachel|  okay. umm, well, first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.|mr. zelner| fair enough.
rachel| now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah,  courage again, and not litigious. look mr|mr. zelner| zelner.
rachel| zelner! right! i knew that! i really, really want this job and i think, i think i would be really good at it.|mr. zelner| y'know what? i may regret this but uh, i'm going to give you a shot.
rachel|  oh! you are?|mr. zelner| um-hmm.
rachel| really? oh thank you! oh oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?|mr. zelner| yes!
rachel| okay, well then how about a handshake? |phoebe| you tired chandler?
monica| you better believe he's tired, after the day we had! if you know what i mean. you know what i mean?|chandler| honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
gary| so uh chandler, you like that badge i got you?|chandler| oh yeah, it's so cool. 
monica| phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.|phoebe| ohh,  umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
gary| yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so|monica| you didn't!
phoebe| we did! we violated section 12 paragraph 7 of the criminal code!|monica| the park huh? a public place.
gary| uh-huh.|monica| i hear ya. excuse me for just a second! 
monica| hi chandler.|chandler| monica! this is the men's room!  isn't it?
monica| yes it is. you see i've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. haven't you?|chandler| no. and if i did, i don't think we'd be going out. monica, this is getting ridiculous!
monica| come on, we can't let them win!|chandler| ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! okay? so why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
monica| because phoebe and gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!|chandler|  so?
monica| i feel really sad that we're notreally there anymore.|chandler| oh wow! is that what this all have been about?
monica| wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?|chandler| yeah that was great. that was really great! but to tell you the truth, i'm more excited about where we are right now.
monica| really?|chandler| yeah! i've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, i think that's pretty incredible. and the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah i think that's pretty exciting. 
monica| that is so sweet. i know that i was acting a little crazy but umm, i feel the same way.|chandler| yeah?
monica| yeah. |chandler| y'know what i just realized? you just freaked out about our relationship.
monica| did not.|chandler| yes you did! admit it! you freaked out!
monica| okay, i freaked out a little.|chandler| little?! you freaked out big time! okay? and i fixed it! we have switched places! i am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up!  and now we're back.
rachel|  i cannot believe ross is buying this!|monica| thank god! i can't watch him anymore!
chandler|  you guys ready fore the movies?|rachel| yeah! oh by the way, thank you for loaning us pamela and yasmine. 
chandler| okay. |joey| all right now, memorize it.  you got it?
chandler| oh yes.|joey| 
chandler|  yes. |carol|  hey guys!
ross| hi!|chandler| hi there!
ben| hi!!|carol| guess what? ben is going to be in a tv commercial!
phoebe| what are you talking about?!|ross|  well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
joey|  man! i've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.|ross| i know, it's crazy! we were just pushing ben on the swings
joey| i'm always on the swings! what am i doing wrong?!|chandler| that.
rachel|  okay, gotta go! wish me luck!|joey| luck!
chandler| hey rach, now that you're working at ralph lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?|rachel| uh well, y'know what? i don't think if i feel comfortable stealing on my very first day
chandler| unwilling to steal from work, interesting.|monica| besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
rachel| okay guys, way to wish me luck!|all| good luck! go get 'em! 
phoebe| okay, let's discuss rachel's birthday. i say we throw a surprise party this weekend.|joey| whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
phoebe| yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.|monica| i think it's a great idea. yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
joey| ross!! we're having a surprise party for rachel!!|ross|  okay!!
joey| done.|phoebe| okay, great so do you want to do it together?
monica| i would love to do it together!|joey| they're gonna do it together.
chandler| dude! that's my girlfriend!|joey| what, so i gotta shut it down now?
ross| all right, i gotta take off. i'm picking up ben then we're off to the big audition.|monica| it's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be ben's dad.
ross| yeah.|chandler| weirder than watching his two moms make out? 
joey| whoa-whoa dad? there's a dad in the commercial?|ross| yeah the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
joey| whoa, hey, maybe i'll go down there with ya and see if i can get an audition to play the dad. i mean who better to play ben's father than his godfather.|ross| you're not his godfather.
joey| what?! are you kidding?!|ross|  okay, let's go godfather.
joey| all right!|joey| hey! i'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
ross| really? that's great!|joey| i know! i know! it turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so i steered clear of her
carol|  hey, that kid looks familiar.|joey| oh yeah, yeah! he's done tons of commercials. i've seen him in like sugar smacks, playstation, and that one for the phone company. in fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. chandler was mad.
ross| yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. ben is way cuter than that kid. i mean look at him, look at you, |joey| that's great. listen, wouldn't it be great though if i got to play ben's dad?
ross| joey, you look nothing like ben.|joey| i look more like him than you do! 
carol| y'know, i don't really know you well enough for you to do that.|kim| so it's down to these two, nancy i know you like this one and i think i agree. rachel, what do you think?
rachel| well umm, that one is pretty but uh, i just, i just love this fabric  sorry.|kim| oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then i take credit for them--i'm kidding.
nancy| she is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. okay, now i'm kidding!|rachel|  oh, what a fun office.
kim| i don't know which one, but i do know i need a cigarette. so what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?|kim|  rachel? do you smoke?
rachel| oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.|rachel| and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
monica| that doesn't seem fair.|rachel| i know! it's like i'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
chandler| yeah, it is the best.|rachel| i mean what if this keeps happening? y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and i'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? me or smokey smokerson?
monica| rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. just say you wanna get some fresh air.|rachel| yeah, i can do that.
chandler| yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.|phoebe|  hey!
monica| hey!|phoebe| hey rach, you wanna get some coffee?
rachel| i would love to!|phoebe| oh good!
chandler| yeah, i wanna go to babe.|phoebe| oh good.
phoebe| oh wait, i change my mind! |monica| yeah, me too! 
phoebe| oh, look at that.|monica| all right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what i thought we would start out with tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my cds! i've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
phoebe| what happened to the intimate dinner party?|monica| oh, we're not doing that. okay
phoebe| so wow, it looks like you took care of everything. thanks a lot, co-host.|monica| what?! i didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
phoebe| like what?|monica|  cups.
phoebe| cups? you're giving me cups?|monica| and ice!
phoebe| cups and ice? ooh, i get to be in charge of cups and ice?  all right. fine, okay, i will be in charge of cups and ice!|monica| wait a minute, i can get ice at the restaurant
phoebe| i got it! mine!|ross|  hi.
monica| hey! how'd the audition go?!|ross| not so good.
monica| wait a minute, are you doing joey's  yeah it did?\|ross|  yeah i am! yeah, ben got a second audition!
joey|  yeah, i had to teach ross my bit because i actually didn't get a callback.|monica| you got a callback too didn't you?
joey|  yeah i did!|kim| hey rachel, what are you doing out here?
rachel| oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so i just thought i would come out here and get some fresh air.|kim| nancy and i were talking about the fall collection.
rachel| oh great!|kim| so anyway we really  honey, we're just smoking all over you.
nancy| oh, sorry!|rachel| oh that's okay.
kim| no-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there. |nancy| so anyway i sent the designs over to ralph and he's very excited about the line.
kim| oh that's great! you are the best!|rachel| excuse me, can i, can i bum one of those?  okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
nancy| i thought you didn't smoke.|rachel| oh, i thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? y'know what i mean, like dubbies? and i actually, i thought to myself, \wow, those guys are crazy!\ but no, i actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
kim| we get high.|rachel| oh, me too.
kim| i'm kidding.|rachel|  oh, me too.
ross| oh god, this is so nerve wracking! how-how do you do this?|joey| well, unfortunately, i don't get many callbacks so
carol| is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?|joey| who knows?
the casting director|  okay uh, we have narrowed it down to raymond, ben, kyle, and joey. the rest of you, thank you very much.|ross| yes!! i knew it!!  bye-bye! so long! later!
joey| oh this is great! i might actually get to play ben's dad!|ross| yeah!
the casting director| actually, that can't happen. yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with raymond and kyle with ben. so it'll be either you two |joey| man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
ross| yeah, it is.|kyle| yeah. it's gonna be weird.
ross| no, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.|kyle| oh, oh, i thought we were just talking.
phoebe|  hey!|ross and chandler| hi!
phoebe| is it okay if i leave this stuff here 'til rachel's birthday party?|chandler| ah sure. what's in 'em?
phoebe| umm, cups.|chandler| oh good, because uh we got rachel 800 gallons of water.
ross| seriously that's a lot of cups.|phoebe| yeah well, that's 'cause monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
chandler| y'know i rued the day oncedidn't get a whole lot else done.|phoebe| okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  oh, hi joey!
joey| hey pheebs!  hey!|ross| hey!
joey| ross good, i'm uh glad you're here. i wanna talk to you about something.|ross| what's up?
joey| well, i've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. so, i think i'm just gonna step aside. i'm gonna tell them that i won't audition.|ross| wow, uh, joey that's-that's great. thanks man.
joey| that's it? you're-you're gonna let me do this?! this-this is my career we're talking about here!|ross| well, you just
joey| i just said that so you wouldn't let ben do it! look ross, if anyone should step aside it should be ben!|ross| what?!
joey| what? chandler! tell 'em!|chandler| 
ross| why should ben step aside? it was his audition in the first place! you-you just tagged along! you're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.|joey| at least i care about his feelings!
ross| what?!|joey| do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesnt get it?
ross| and why wouldn't he get it?|joey| oh, come on! have you seen what my kid can do?! huh?! i mean he dials phones! he-he-he eats tortilla chips! he-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
ross| are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?|joey| you just give him a spoon baby!
ross| oh yeah? i guess we'll just see!|joey| yeah! because this commercial belongs to me and mitch!
ross| you're kid's name is raymond!|joey| yeah?! so's yours!
monica|  how did work go?|rachel| oh it was great! it was great! i went down there just like you said, y'know? and we talked business. kim totally took my opinions.
monica| you stink!|rachel| thanks!
monica| no, i'm-i'm serious!|rachel| well-well that's 'cause i went down there and they were all smoking. this is actually the smell of success.
chandler| okay, there's something different though--oh my god! you smoked!|rachel| i did not!
chandler| yes you did! you look happy and sick; you smoked!|rachel| all right, fine! but i had too! i had to do it for my career!
chandler| i wish i had smoked for my career|monica| that's so gross!
rachel| no well, no it's not that bad, y'know? i mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, i actually feel like i can throw up.|chandler| okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
monica| chandler! i have to tell you, you smell so smokey i have to get up. i'm not kidding. |chandler| i think you smell great! 
kim| so, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?|nancy| absolutely!
rachel| i am so on board! |kim| rachel didn't you just light that?
rachel| yeah, i did, but y'know what? i am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  good luck, rach.|nancy| i've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
kim| oh sure, every sunday night i'm telling myself i'm quitting but every monday morning it's like |nancy| tell me about it!
rachel| well then let's just quit! we'll just quit! let's all quit!|kim| it does sound appealing.
nancy| oh, i never could do it.|rachel| oh but you could. you can. absolutely! we can help each other out! we can get--what are those--those patches! we could be like the patch sisters!
kim| oh y'know, we really should quit. okay, let's quit!|rachel| yes! great! give me those cigs! give it! give it!

ross| no really, i-i am! i feel bad!|joey| yeah? well look ross, you don't have to. okay? it's not your fault i suck. i mean what kind of an actor can't even say, \hmm, noodle soup.\ 
ross| yeah y'know what? maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.|joey| what you do mean?
ross| i think, sub-consciously|joey| wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
ross|  i think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that ben would get the part.|joey| well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.  yeah. yeah! it's not that i'm a bad actor
ross| no!|joey| no, it's just ah, i care so damn much about little ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
ross| there you go. thank you!|joey| thank you! so, did-did he get it?
ross| no.|joey| eh, what are you gonna do?
chandler|  oh, hi! excuse me, is uh rachel green here? i was supposed to meet her for lunch.|kim| oh, she doesn't come down here any more. you can find her up on ten.

chandler| made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert. |delivery girl| hi chandler!
chandler| hey caitlin! somebody got a haircut.|caitlin| ugh, i hate it! i look like an 8-year-old boy.

chandler| oh, okay.  here you go. |caitlin| hey, where's the chicken?
chandler| oh, he's in the back. the duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.|caitlin|  great. i'll see you later!

chandler| i was not flirting.|ross| it was totally flirting. \somebody got a haircut \
chandler| okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. and second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. that is all.|ross| yeah, right.
chandler| you wanna see flirting? i'll show you flirting. |ross|  i'm good.
rachel| i am so proud of joey, i can't believe he's going to be on law & order!|phoebe| i know. but don't you think that it should be called order and law?
rachel| no because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.|phoebe| don't get me started on that.
chandler| i was not flirting.|ross| and on your anniversary, for shame!
rachel| what's going on?|ross| chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
chandler| i was not and oh god, shh!|ross| well i'm sorry but you were! okay? and besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
phoebe| sounds like somebody wants to be mr. pizza delivery girl.|ross| well
chandler| is that what this is about? you like caitlin?|rachel| ross! we broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. i think it's okay that we see other people.
ross| well, i-i was watching her the other day at the pizza place.|rachel| hm-mmm.
ross| and she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little|rachel| okay, y'know what? we don't need her measurements. 
phoebe|  okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay ross, i know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! she forgot my vegetarian!|ross| this is perfect! she'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, i'll turn on the charm-o-ross. oh i'm so glad you don't eat meat.
phoebe| see? vegetarianism benefits everyone.|joey|  hey everybody, look who's here! you remember my grandmother!
rachel| big night!|phoebe| this is so cool!
chandler| so, joey on law & order, you must be very proud!|joey| chandler, she doesn't understand a word of english.
chandler| i'm sorry, i thought you were joey's other grandmother.  i've done it again.|joey| she's my biggest fan. yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.

rachel| uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.|ross| and thank you, for that.
rachel| but y'know, i never really had anything to worry about. ross was never very good at the flirting thing.|ross| what?  what-what, what are talking about? it-it worked with you.

phoebe| ohh! i did not get that.|chandler| so uh monica, do you, do you like the law & order?
monica| yeah, it's good.|chandler| see, i'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the law & order and that you flirted with every guy in the tri-state area!
monica| chandler!  okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.|chandler| oh, i'm so glad we cleared that up. look, i'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
monica| go on, teach me something about men and women.|chandler| okay, i've already taught you so much already, but whatever. see when you flirt with a guy you think, \i'm just flirting, no big deal.\ but the guy is thinking, \finally! somebody who wants to sleep with me!\
monica| no way!|chandler| it's true.
monica| well that's pathetic!|chandler| again true.
monica| and this goes for all guys?|chandler| all guys that are awake. then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.

ross| yeah, no one talks like that!|joey| oh what? like your mr. cop!
ross| hey, i'm more cop than you two!|chandler| how do you figure that?
ross| hello! i'm in the front seat, okay? i'm gary's partner!|chandler| y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. it, it sounds gay.

monica|  nooo!|rachel|  i know!
monica| well thank god you were here! i mean, we have to erase that!|rachel| what?! we can't do that!
monica| we have too! i mean what if ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? is that what you want? ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy emily? the emily that wouldn't let him see you?|rachel| noo! oh no! no! god no! he should not get back together with her. i know that! you know that! even ross knows that! but that still doesnt give us the right to erase his message!
monica| i'm his sister, okay? i love him! i don't want to see him get hurt! come on! doesnt that give me the right to control himhelp him?|rachel| i don't think he's the one who needs help.
monica| no, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? i mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.  okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! although it did involve a lot of the same people.|rachel| ugh!
monica| y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.|rachel| okay, you are crazy! i'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! i mean, listen! 
answering machine| your messages have been erased.|rachel| noooooooo!
chandler| okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? i mean nothing bad can go down!|gary| no. but that reminds me,  sign this.
ross| what is it?|gary| oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
chandler|  oh, hurry up. i want to sign that.|gary| okay, here he comes. what is he doing? what the hell is he doing?!
ross| what? what? what? what is it?|joey| is everything okay?
chandler| what's going on?|gary| okay, he sees us. now don't move. don't look at him.
gary| hey, it's okay. it was just a car backfire.  hey, look at that! you tried to save your buddy. you see that? you see what he did?|joey|  you okay man?
ross| uh-huh. thank joey!|chandler| uh, hello!!
joey| hi.|monica| all right, i guess we should go.
rachel| no, wait. wait.|monica| oh yeah right! 
rachel| no, monica! monica! we have to fix this!|monica| there's nothing we can do. you erased the message!
rachel| yeah well unless we tell him.|monica| well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, i can't argue with you! all right? fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. i just don't want to be a part of it.
rachel| oh, maybe that's emily calling back to leave the exact same message.|ross| 
monica| wow! play that message for emily and this whole problem goes away!|rachel| right?
gary| hey, anybody want to meet a hero?|phoebe|  john glenn is here?!
gary| no, joey!|ross| pheebs, we had the most incredible night! okay, so, we're in the car
gary| wait! hold on!  hi!|phoebe| hi!
gary|  okay, go ahead.|ross| okay, okay, so we're in the car. right? and bang! a shot was fired. and joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
phoebe| my god, joey!|chandler|  it was a car backfire!
ross| yeah, but-but he didn't know that!|joey| yeah, i didn't know that.
ross| and it could've just as easily have been a bullet.|gary| hey joe, you ever think about joining the force? we could use a guy like you.
chandler| who jumps at loud noises!|ross| wow! i could've died tonight.
chandler| yeah! if the car that backfired had run over you! y'know what, i think i'll go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. |ross| i do have a newfound respect for life.
chandler| |gary|  so you wanna get some dinner?
phoebe| yeah! sure! yep!  oh, y'know what? if i heard a shot right now, i'd throw my body on you.|gary| oh yeah? well maybe you and i should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
phoebe| okay!|gary| all right.
phoebe| bye!|ross and joey| bye!
joey| cut it out ross! i hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!|joey| dude! how come you took off? 
chandler| oh, i just went for a walk, around the living room. whatever|joey| is something wrong?
chandler| no. no i'm just tired. y'know, from-from the walk.|joey| okay.
chandler| you dove in front of ross! ross!|joey| that's what this is about! oh my god, you hate ross!
chandler| i do not hate ross!|joey| of course you do! i saved him! you're mad at me! it all adds up! you want ross out of the picture.
chandler| what picture?|joey| i don't know, but i don't like what i'm hearing!
chandler| look i'm very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!|joey| ohh, you're upset because you think i chose ross over you! no! iknewyou could take care of yourself. y'know, i mean ross, he need help. he's not street like us!
chandler| when it comes down to it, you would risk your life for ross before you would for me. that's the bottom line.|joey| well, no, not exactly! all right, look, i, i wasn't trying to save ross. okay? my sandwich was next to ross. all right? i was, i was trying to save my sandwich.
chandler| from a bullet!|joey| i know it doesn't make much sense
chandler| much sense?!|joey| look chandler, it was instinct! okay? i just went for it!
chandler| so you risked your life, for a sandwich!|joey| i know it sounds crazy, but chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!
chandler| so you didn't uh, choose ross before me.|joey| no! i would never do that! you-you're like my brother!
chandler| really?!|joey| yeah! in fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here.
chandler| thanks. |joey| no, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
joey| how good is that?|chandler|  oh-oi-ho, yeah!
joey| see?|chandler| hm-hmm. 
joey| oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!|chandler| i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
joey| yeah. with a bite!  gee-e-e-eez!|rachel| hey! hi!
ross| rach, what uh, what are you doing here?|rachel| hey! y'know what? you are in our apartment all the time! okay? this is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
ross| y'know, it-it doesn't matter. the important thing is that you're here. you're my friend, and you're here. oh! |rachel| okay, just a little scared. what's going on ross?
ross| the most amazing thing happened tonight. i thought my number was up. i had an actual near death experience!|rachel| what?! what? what happened?!
ross| okay, okay, we were on the ride along with gary, right? |rachel| yeah!
ross| and somebody took a shot at me!|rachel|  really?!
ross| no, a car backfired, but  i thought somebody was taking a shot at me. and rach, ii survived! and i was filled with this-this great respect for life. y'know? i-i want to experience every moment. i want to seize every opportunity. i-i am seeing everything so-so clearly now.|rachel| because a car backfired?
ross|  okay, why are you here?|rachel| well, i-i-i don't know how this fits into your whole \seizing\ thing but um, emily called you today.
ross| you talked to her?|rachel| no, she left a message.  something wrong with your machine.
ross| well, okay, what-what did she say?|rachel| well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
ross| wow!|rachel| now, that-that was a good thing that i told you, right?
ross| huh? yeah! yes, of course!|rachel| okay. thank you! thank you! becausei'm sorry, all right. because y'know what? she didn't want menot important. the point is, i was right. your decision. okay? i was right.  your decision.
ross| right. i guess, i guess i should call emily.|rachel| okay, no, that's not the right decision. that's not, that's not right, no ross-ross, come on! i mean, that woman made you miserable! okay, ross, do you really want to get back into that?
ross| okay, look, yesterday i would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience. i mean, that-that has got to mean something!|rachel| ugh, ross! that was not a near death experience! that was barely an experience!
ross| you weren't there! okay, maybe this is something that i-i'm supposed to seize! y'know?|rachel| okay, y'know what? maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. maybe this is about escaping stuff.
ross| huh.|rachel| i mean, look-look today you escaped  death, y'know? and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily?
ross| that does make sense. because i do wanna seize some opportunity, but i-i really don't wanna see or talk to her.|rachel| well, there you go!
ross| yeah. maybe today is just, close call day.|rachel|  close call day.
ross| hey, thanks rach. |rachel| ohh, honey no problem. okay. 
ross| oh wait-wait-wait! the message is blinking. maybe you didn't erase it. |rachel| oh?
ross|  oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.|rachel| no. 
ross|  hey umm, was-was monica here?|rachel| yeah.
ross| yeah, i want my money back.|rachel|  yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
ross| hey pheebs, has gary ever been shot at for real?|phoebe| yes. once. yeah, a little. he kinda did it to himself. it's not really a good story.
ross| i wonder how i would react under fire, y'know? and not backfire but-but heavy fire, like i was in a war or something.|monica| man, i would be great in a war! i mean, i really, i think i would make a fantastic military leader. i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys.
chandler| before or after you were shot by your own troops?|ross| i know where joey would be. he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
chandler| yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.|joey| yeah, hero sandwiches. 
phoebe| i'm fine, thanks.|chandler|  yeah, see, i can't pull of baby-doll can i?
monica| no. i think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. i'm gonna get some tea.|chandler| okay.
chandler| hiya doin' pumpkin?|phoebe| nope. 
monica| so it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?|gary| i know, really well. in fact, i'm gonna ask phoebe to move in with me.
monica|  oh my god!|gary| what do you, what do you think?
monica| i think that is so great! when are you gonna ask her?|gary| tonight, but don't say anything. okay?
monica| i swear, i promise. i promise. oh my god, i'm so excited! {and i just can't hide it! i'm about to lose control and i think i like it! sorry, just couldn't resist it.} all right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. okay? because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral|gary| 
phoebe| okay. bye! |phoebe| so, what movie should we see?
monica|  gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!|phoebe| what?! really?!
monica| he just told me at the counter. he made me promise not to tell, but i couldn't hold it in any longer!|phoebe| i can't believe this!
chandler|  right, because it's fast. because, it's so fast. it's fast!|monica| relax! it's phoebe! not you!
chandler| oh! good for you pheebs, way to go! |phoebe| no, but it is fast. isn't it?
monica| ohhhh!|phoebe| no, i like him a lot but i don't think i'm ready for this!
chandler| so, what are you gonna do?|phoebe| i don't know. i'll just handle iti'll ask you to talk to him!
chandler| me?! why me?|phoebe| because you are so afraid of commitment! you talk to him, make him scared like you! make him aman!
chandler| i'll try, but i'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? because i'm a lot less afraid of commitment than i used to be.|monica| that is so sweet! 
chandler| |joey| hey ross, is uh, is staten island really an island?
ross| uh-huh, that's why they call it staten island.|joey| ohhh. i thought it was like long island.
ross|  also an island.|joey| hey, what time is it?
ross|  2:17.|joey| wow! you realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
ross| are you serious?!|joey| yeah. i realized it about a half-hour ago but i didn't want to say anything 'cause i didn't want to jinx it.
ross| wow! we are pretty good at this! hey! we totally forgot about lunch!|joey| oh, i-i, i think that's the first time i ever missed a meal!  yeah, my pants are a little loose!
rachel|  hey, you guys|joey| hey!
rachel| is monica here?|joey and ross| no.
rachel| all right listen umm, i just bought something i'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that i wanted since i was a little girl.|ross| you bought shawn cassidy!
rachel| noo! i wish! okay, you ready? |joey and ross| yeah!
rachel| okay!  check it out!|ross| what-what is it?!
joey| what the hell is that?!!|rachel| it's a, it's a cat!
joey| that, is not a cat! {i have to agree with joey on this one.}|rachel| yes it is!
ross| why is it inside out?!|rachel| excuse me! but this is a purebred, show-quality sphinx cat!
ross| how much did you pay for that?|rachel| well, it was a little extravagant, but i a pretty good deal.
ross| yeah? how much?|rachel| a thousand bucks.
ross| on a cat??!!!!|joey| it's not a cat!
rachel| all right listen ball boys! my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! i mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!|ross| free cats do that too, y'know. {which reminds me, if i might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. if you want a leash, go to the pet shop. if you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
joey| it's not a cat!|rachel| ugh! look you guys, i'm really excited about this! okay? i don't care what you think! i'm gonna go set up a little litter box for mrs. whiskerson.  well, what am i gonna call her? fluffy?!
ross|  hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? huh?|joey| uhh, the ball thing.
ross| yeah?|joey| hey ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
ross| uhh, yeah it would! let's do it!|joey| okay!
joey|  uh-oh.|ross| what?
joey| i have to pee. and rachel's in the bathroom!|joey| man, i didn't think we were gonna make it!
ross| i know!  don't switch hands, okay?|chandler| hey ladies! what are you in here for? 
gary| hey chandler, what are you doing here?|chandler| gary, i'm here to report a crime.
gary| yeah?|chandler| it is a crime that you and i don't spend more time together.
gary|  what's up?|chandler| well, i heard that you thinking about asking phoebe to move in with you and i thought maybe, we should have a talk. man to uh, me.
gary| sure. okay.|chandler| uh, are you crazy? are you insane? if you live with phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
gary| yeah, i-i considered that. i just know it would make me happy.|chandler| you mean scared.
gary| no, i mean happy.|chandler| scared? happy?
gary| chandler, what-what are you doing?|chandler| i am trying to open your eyes, my man! don't you see, if you lived with phoebe she's always gonna be there. you're gonna get home, she's there. you go to bed, she's there. you wake up and oh yes, she's there!
gary| i know! i can't wait!|chandler| were you're parents happy, or something?
gary| listen chandler, the way i see it is that i was lucky enough to find someone that i really love. i justi wanna be around her as much as i can.|chandler| wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
gary| so you know what i'm talking about, right?|chandler| yeah, i think i do! y'know what? you move in with her! you move in with her right now! maybe i should in with monica!
gary| no, it's too soon for you guys.|chandler|  yeah, you're right about that.
ross| now when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws! how did it get there?!|joey| maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
monica|  hey guys!|joey| hi!
monica| joey, i left my watch on the counter last night.  it was right here, where is it?|joey| i don't know.
monica| all right, come on, i'm-i'm late for work!|ross| how do you know? you don't have a watch.
monica| guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!|joey| oh, i don't know. yeah, can't do it.
monica| what?!|ross| monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
joey| yeah, we haven't dropped it in |ross| 2 hours, 27 minutes.
monica| really?!|monica| 
ross| hey rach!|rachel| hey.
ross| check it out! almost 3 hours without droppin' it!|rachel| oh, wow! congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
monica| rach?|rachel| yeah?
monica| you have scratches all over you, what happened? |rachel| well, it's my cat.
monica|  what?!|rachel| oh yeah, i got a cat.
monica| i don't want a cat!|joey| oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
ross| yeah.|rachel| you guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. i mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, i even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. and i swear, i know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me i know it's saying, \rachel!\
ross| doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.|monica|  what?! you paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
rachel| well, i was gonna let you play with it.|chandler| hi!
phoebe| hmm, did you talk to gary about the moving in thing?|chandler| yes i did, and i think you should do it.
phoebe| what?!|chandler| he's a great guy, y'know? and he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
phoebe| you are useless! freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! the one thing! and you can't even do that right! god!|chandler| im sorry.  if you ask me, i'd move in with him.
phoebe| ohh!! god!  get out of here, good for nothing.|gary| hey chandler.
chandler| hey gar!|gary|  hi, can i talk to you for a second?
phoebe| yeah! okay. |gary| you look very pretty today.
phoebe| thanks! okay. |gary| here's the thing.
phoebe| yeah?|gary| y'know i really want to move this relationship forward.
phoebe| uh-hmm.|gary| because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
phoebe| no that's not true. if you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. and staying still is good. watch this.  |gary| phoebe?
phoebe| yeah?|gary| i want you to move in with me.
phoebe| that is so sweet. but don't you think it's a little too soon? i mean there's so much we don't know about each other.|gary|  oh. oh-oh-okay, i get it.
phoebe| i justi don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.|gary|  uh-huh.
phoebe| i really don't want to mess up what we have. i'm justi'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.|gary|  yeah.
phoebe| which is why my answer is yes!|gary|  really?!
phoebe| uh-huh! |ross|  monica! stop throwing it so hard! we're on the same team!
chandler| four hours? you guys have been doing this for four hours?|joey| that's right baby.
chandler| all right, let me in. |monica|  no-no! don't do it! don't!
chandler| what?|monica| he's a dropper!
joey| oh yeah, that's right!|chandler| i'm not a dropper!
ross| it's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?|chandler| it's throwing and catching!
ross| all right. |chandler| oh! oh! that's so hard. 
joey| whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!|monica| oh myoh good god!
rachel|  i give up you guys, i don't know what i'm going to do with this thing!|ross| baking it didn't help, huh?
monica| so, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?|rachel| i tried! they won't take her back.
chandler| maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-christ.|monica| rach, why won't they take it back?
rachel| well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. i mean, what am i going to do, get a thousand regular cats?|monica| look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
rachel| no mon that's not the point. i'm out a thousand dollars, i'm all scratched up, and i'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! |monica| oh my god, the cat's made my eyes water! don't-don't throw it to me! my vision's been compromised!!  oh god! okay. okay. it's okay. man, that was close.
chandler| yeah, you almost overreacted to something.|phoebe and gary|  hey!

phoebe| okay, yeah, i'll see you later! don't forget about the moving in!|gary| all right.
monica| so you're moving in with him. what happened?|phoebe| i couldn't tell him no. he got so sad. maybe it'll be all right. i do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money i'll save on stamps.
monica| why, do you write him a lot?|phoebe| no, i just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. don't they?
all| yeah! that's right. yeah-yeah! yeah!|phoebe| oh, i'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
gary| hey, honey! okay, so did you find any apartments? anything in brooklyn heights?|phoebe| no, nothing.
gary| oh really?|phoebe| yeah.

gary| let me tell you what i think might be going on.  okay, i think somebody asked someone to move in with them. and i think someone said, \yes\ but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. does that sound at all possible to you?|phoebe| yes. yes! fine! i am someone! you want me to say it? i have doubts! 
gary| phoebe|phoebe| yeah?
gary| phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. i mean it is soon. and there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and i just figure that everything i really like. and the things i don't know, i get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.|phoebe| that's so sweet.
gary| sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. it's fine! we don't have to move in together. i justi want you to be happy|phoebe| living with you would make me happy.
gary| phoebe, you don't have to say that.|phoebe| no, i really wanna live with you! i wanna move in with you!

chandler| joey kicked me out of the car on the george washington bridge!|all| why?!
chandler| i don't know! he went crazy! y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.|phoebe| that game should not be played without my supervision. 
chandler| well, i don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? all i said was that uh, i didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.|phoebe| what's in the bag?
chandler| oh, i figured you guys would all be mad at me. so i got you some gifts that i found on the side of the road.  who wants the teddy bear with one leg?|phoebe| i do!
rachel| okay. |monica| not even close.
rachel| okay, then y'know what? help me! i need help! i can't do this!|monica| okay! all right! let's do it!

phoebe| ooh that is definitely chandler, joey, or ross.  or-or rachel!|monica|  i'm so glad you called! chandler told me what happened. y'know he's really upset about it.
joey|  not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what i did with his sweater vests!|monica| what did you do to his sweater vests?

monica| well, maybe you should send him something. so that when he gets to las vegas he'll know that you're sorry.|chandler| that's a good idea. i wonder where i could  get a basket of porn
phoebe| no, don't-don't say i'm sorry with porn!|chandler| really?
phoebe| y'know what you should send him? a cartoon of cigarettes. 'cause that why he could trade it for protection. no. that's prison.|ross|  okay pheebs, i know how we're going to figure this out. okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. okay?

joey| that's it! thanks pheebs!|chandler|  hey!
phoebe|  ooh, do you want to talk to chandler?|chandler|  let me talk to him!

phoebe| monica! i'm sorry i'm late! |monica|  oh, phoebe, i'm so sorry. have you been here long?
phoebe|  it's okay. what the hell took you so long?|monica| okay, you can not tell chandler. okay? that i ran into richard.
phoebe| which richard?|monica| the richard.
phoebe| richard simmons?! oh my god!|monica| noo! my ex-boyfriend richard! y'know the tall guy, moustache? 
phoebe| oh! okay, that actually makes more sense. so how was it?|monica| it was, it was really nice. we started talking and i-i ended up having lunch with him.
phoebe| that is so weird! i had a dream that you'd have lunch with richard.|monica| really?
phoebe| but again, simmons. go on.|monica| the strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but i didn't feel anything at all!
phoebe| ooh! so now why can't we tell chandler?|monica| because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. i just don't want anything to spoil that.
phoebe| oh, i can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!|monica| i know.
phoebe| wow! i owe rachel 20 bucks!|monica| what?
phoebe| on a totally different bet.|chandler|  hey!
monica| it's almost our anniversary!|chandler| i know. can you believe it? one year ago today i was just your annoying friend chandler.
phoebe| awww! now you're just my annoying friend chandler.|chandler| huh.
monica| i got you a present!|chandler| oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
monica| i know, but you have to open it today! |chandler| okay.
monica|  okay! there you go! it's two tickets to vegas!|chandler| wow!
monica| for this weekend! oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. we can call it out plane-aversary.|chandler| do we have to?
monica| no.|chandler| okay this is great, but joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
monica| oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! plus we get to have our own, ani-vegas-ary! a-nevadaversary!|chandler| yeah, i think we should see other people.
monica| but we can go, right?|chandler| yes.
monica| okay!|chandler| it's a great idea. 
phoebe| okay, i'm gonna go too!|chandler| y'know pheebs, it's kinda our  anniversary.
phoebe| oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with london.|monica| ditch you? phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
phoebe| uh-huh, great story! i'm going!|rachel|  hi!
phoebe| hey!|ross| hey!
phoebe| hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to las vegas to surprise joey! including me!! you wanna go?!|rachel| well, i guess i could take a couple days off work.
phoebe| of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!|rachel| oh no, wait a minute, wait, i've got a presentation tomorrow. i can't miss that.
ross| oh, but i've got tickets to the van gogh exhibit! i've been waiting like a year for this.|chandler|  art lover!
ross| what'd you say?|chandler| i said art lover.
ross| is that supposed to be an insult?|chandler| i don't know, i'm very tired. 
ross| so rach, maybe you and i could fly out together saturday.|rachel| that sounds great.
ross| yeah? all right i'll call the airlines. |rachel| okay. yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
phoebe| oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.|rachel| no! so i can be by myself. y'know? have a little alone time.
phoebe| naked alone time.|rachel| no! phoebe just because i'm alone doesnt mean i wanna walk around naked. i mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
phoebe| uh-huh! why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?|phoebe| so, so far is this trip to vegas better or worse than the trip to london?
chandler| so it's pretty much the same pheebs.|phoebe| okay, what about after i give you these candies? 
chandler| yeah, i guess it's a little better now.|phoebe| ah-ha! okay, 
chandler|  happy plane-aversary.|monica| aww! i love you!
chandler| can i give you a present now?|monica| okay!
chandler| okay!  oh man! dont tell me i did this!|monica| i love the \i forgot the present\ fake out!
chandler| how do you feel about the, \i really did forgot the present, please forgive me\ not fake out?|monica| oh that's okay. dont worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
chandler| ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!|phoebe|  oh good! all right, so you decided to tell him about the richard thing.
chandler| what-what richard thing?|phoebe| oh no. 
chandler| what richard thing?|phoebe|  simmons! go with simmons!
monica| okay, i umm, i ran into richard yesterday and he asked me if i wanted to go for a bite and i did. the only reason i didn't tell you is because i knew you'd get mad and i didn't want to spoil our anniversary.|chandler|  i'm not mad.
monica| really?!|chandler| oh yeah! yeah, so you-you bumped into richard! you grabbed a bite! it's no big deal. 
monica| great!|phoebe| okay, london 1
rachel| |ross|  okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokesunless she wants me to be looking at that. she knows i'm home. she knows i can see her. what kind of game is she playing? i think maybe someone's lonely tonight. oh-ho, dr. geller! stop it! you're being silly! or, am i?
rachel|  |ross| hey.
ross| may i come in?|rachel| uh, yeah, if you want too.
ross| do you want me too?|rachel| yeah, sure?
ross| so do i. |rachel| and um, what-what is that ross?
ross| the physical act of love. |rachel|  what?! are you crazy?
ross| oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?|rachel|  oh god, you saw me?! oh!
ross| you weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.|rachel| noo!! no! you thought, you actually thought i wanted to have sex with you?!
ross| no! no! |rachel| ohh wow! im sorry, but ross you kicked off your shoes!
ross| can we, can we just forget this ever happened?|rachel| yes of course, absolutely! you're right. i'm sorry.
ross| thank you.|rachel| yes.
ross| all right i guess i'm, gonna go pack. |rachel| okay. oh wait! one more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of \us?\
phoebe| hey you guys wait! guys!  this place is so much better than london! okay? this lady dressed like cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. huh!|monica| phoebe, you don't eat animals. 
phoebe| for 99 cents, i'd eat you.  oh! look! hi!|chandler| oh my god.
phoebe| hey! joey! |joey| hi!
chandler| love your condoms my man.|joey| what-what are you guys doing here? i thought i told you not to come.
phoebe| why are you dressed as a gladiator?|joey| uhh, because i'm shooting a scene right now. yeah, i uh, i play a gladiator. uh, y'know what? hold-hold on a second.  can we cut? yeah, my-my friends are here, i'm gonna take a little break.
monica| who are you talking too?|joey| they uh director. uhh, her.  all right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. i work here.
chandler| why?! what happened?!|joey| well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so i'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
monica| i'm so sorry.|joey| look, i'm sorry i didn't tell ya.  i'm sorry man.
chandler| no-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.|monica| i knew you were not okay with that.
phoebe| so you're a gladiator! wow!|joey| yeah, what-what's going on?
phoebe| monica had lunch with richard.|joey| dawson?! 
phoebe| noo! but that would've been so cool!|chandler| no! her boyfriend richard!
monica| it meant nothing! okay? after all this time, how can you not trust me?|chandler| when you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
monica| you're right. i'm sorry. i should've told you.|chandler| thanks. 
joey| aww, there we go.|phoebe| i love vegas!
monica| i promise you, next time i will absolutely tell you.|chandler|  next time?
joey| ooh, so close.|chandler| there's not gonna be a next time! you can not ever see him again!
monica| i can not see him? i mean, you can't tell me what to do!|chandler| that's so funny, because i think i just did!
monica| oh y'know what? if you're gonna be acting like this all night, i really, i don't even want to be around you.|chandler| fine with me!
monica| fine! happy anniversary!|joey| whoa! whoa! guys! please! come on! come on! this is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
monica| no it is not!|chandler| what are you talking
joey| hey-hey don't look at me! i just work here! |rachel|  okay umm, ross? i'm-i'm really warm, so i'm going to be taking off my sweater. now, i'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
ross|  yep! that's hilarious!|rachel| i'm sorry. i'm done. i'm done.
ross| y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.|rachel| no, not really. i mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
ross| uh-huh. but it was a first for the rest of my building.|rachel| okay. all right, that's true! but y'know i just don't embarrass that easily.
ross| what?! you totally get embarrassed!|rachel| no, i don't! ross, i think i'm just a more secure person than you are.
ross| is that so?|rachel| yeah.
ross| |joey| hey, y'know in roman times this was more than just a hat.
chandler| really?|joey| yeah, sure! sure! they would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! they would use it to get the mud off their shoe. and sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right
chandler|  joey, i uh! i can't believe this is how i'm spending my anniversary.|joey| all right well, i'll take you someplace nice then. look! a guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
chandler| whoa!|joey| yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. can you believe that? $5,000!
chandler| y'know, if i won $5,000 i'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit richard from behind with a stick! |joey| wait a minute! why don't i do what that guy did? i'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! and then i'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
chandler| good luck! |joey| chandler! i don't need luck. i have thought this through!
chandler| i see.|monica|  thank you.
phoebe| thanks.|monica| i can't believe this! this is like the worst night ever!
phoebe| y'know monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with chandler. big deal! it's only chandler.  i am so sorry.|monica| this is crazy! i mean, it's such a stupid argument. i don't even wanna see richard again.
phoebe| so go fix it! go find chandler! he's probably up in your room! tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.|monica| y'know what? you're right phoebe. you're right. thank you!

ross| once you know the stories, its not that bad. first marriage, wifes hidden sexuality, not my fault. second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. third marriage, well they really shouldnt allow you to get married when youre that drunk and have writing all over your face, nevadas fault.|phoebe| okay, so what do you think ladies? who wouldnt be interested? who wouldnt want to date him?
stephanie| well the divorces dont bother me, id date him. but, not while hes still married.|phoebe| okay, what about you?  wouldnt you want a date?
karin| actually, im dating at all anymore. see, i figured out that i was only dating guys that were like yknow bad for me, so until i work that out|phoebe|  whatever! what about you meg?
meg| well, i dont care about the divorces either, but i wouldnt date him. its just that hes obviously still in love with this rachel girl.|ross| what?!
phoebe| |ross| this is crazy! i mean, yes-yes rachel is my good friend and i-i have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
phoebe| well, i thought you loved her when you-when you married her.|ross| we were drunk! i wouldve married uh, joey with that amount of alcohol!
phoebe| hey! you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani!! |ross|  look, im sorry, but you guys are wrong. i just dont want to be divorced three times.
phoebe| yes, and now hes using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. i must say, \well done!\ bravo meg.|ross| nothing!!
meg| okay now i wouldnt date you because you seem a little creepy.|karin| i am so attracted to him right now.
chandler| okay, when are we gonna tell rachel what is actually gonna happen?|monica| soon! i-i just couldnt before. you saw how upset joey got! i couldnt do that to her, shes my best friend!
chandler| well, joeys my best friend.|monica| im not your best friend?

chandler| okay, bye! |monica| rach, theres something uh, important i have to tell you.
rachel|  are you pregnant?!|monica| no! but, im throwing this shirt away! i think there was a little misunderstanding before.
rachel| um-hmm.|monica| umm, when i said that uh, that chandler and i wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
rachel|  oh my god! oh, thats funny, i cant believe i did that.|monica| oh no sweetie, no! this is my fault, i wasnt clear! im really sorry. and listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? theres absolutely no rush.
rachel| okay. |monica| okay. dont you want a cookie?
rachel| sure?  thanks.|monica| maybe, do you need a tissue?
rachel| monica, where did you get these?!|monica| i made them!
rachel| ooh, good god, theyre so yummy! |joey| god, its gonna so weird like when i come home and youre not here. yknow? no more joey and chans. no more j and cs. \you wanna go over to joey and chandlers?\ \cant, its not there.\
chandler| look, im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.|joey| yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
chandler| not once did we do that.|monica|  hi.
chandler| hey!|joey| hi.
monica| so i, i told rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.|chandler| oh yeah? well, howd she take it?
monica| really well. yeah. surprisingly well. yeah, she didnt cry. she wasnt angry or sad. |chandler| and youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?
monica| i mean, all im asking for is just a little emotion! is that too much to ask after six years?! i mean what? are-are-are rachel and i not as close as you guys?! i mean do we not have as much fun?! dont i deserve a few tears?!! i mean we-we told joey, he cried his eyes out!|joey| hey! i did not cry my eyes out!! come on! its like the end of an era! no more j-man and channies!! 
chandler| okay, i gotta ask, who calls us that?!|russell| you got married again.
ross| yes.|russell| so thats your second marriage in two years.
ross| yes, second in two years. third overall.|russell| ross, i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had i so much business from one client. why dont you tell me what happened.
ross| basically, rachel and i were in vegas and we got drunk|russell|  im sorry, is this the same rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
ross| yes-yes-yes! but, i-i do not love her.|russell| oh, thats better then.
ross| this was just a drunken mistake and i need to get it annulled.|russell| i see. have you considered therapy?
ross| i think just the annulment for today.|russell| there are a couple of forms to fill out.
ross| easy.|russell| and well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
ross| no problem.|russell| and well need you and rachel to testify before a judge.
ross| ooh! theres no way to do this without her? cause i kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.|russell| of course you did. look ross, you cant get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there.
ross| uh-ha, what about someone who looks like rachel?  i will think about the therapy.|rachel| hey!
monica| hey. so um, i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.|rachel| okay!
monica| yknow, no point in dragging it out. dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.|rachel| okay.
monica| hey rach, what about this?  huh? who-who gets this? see, i dont know if i want it because it might be yknow, too many memories!|rachel|  what the hell is that?
monica| i dont know.  hey, rachel, you want the big plate? i want you to have the big plate.|rachel| wow! mon, thanks! i love this plate!
monica| something to remember me by!|rachel| mon, honey youre not dying. im just moving out. yknow, i mean were gonna see each other all the time.
monica| but still, its a big change. the end of an era, you might say!|rachel| are you okay? youre not blinking.
monica| im fine! i just, im thinking how much its an end of era.|rachel| oh, all right. but yknow i gotta say, i dont, i dont think six years counts as an era.
monica| an era is defined as a significant period of time. now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasnt significant to you!|rachel| what is the matter with you?!
monica| what is the matter with you?!! why arent you more upset?! arent you gonna be sad that were not gonna be living together anymore?! i mean arent you gonna miss me at all?!|rachel| all right, fine, but dont get mad at me. its-its just a little hard to believe.
monica| whats hard to believe?|rachel| well yknow, its you guys. you-you do this kind of stuff! yknow? i mean, you-you were gonna get married in vegas and then you backed out! i guess im not upset because i dont see you guys going through with it. im sorry.
monica| rachel, its going to happen. chandler is gonna move in here.|rachel| but i
monica| no-no, wait! just let me finish, okay? this isnt something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in vegas, this is something we both really want. and it is going to happen.|rachel| it is? really?
monica| yeah, sweetie.|rachel|  i mean were not, were not gonna live together anymore?
monica| no.|rachel| what? oh my god! im gonna miss you so much! 
monica| im gonna miss you! |rachel| i mean its the end of an era!
monica| i know!|phoebe|  okay, bye!
ross| oh no.|phoebe| so? did you get the annulment?
ross| i couldnt.|phoebe| i knew it! because you love rachel.
ross| its not that. okay? annulments are more complicated than i|phoebe| yeah, complicated cause of the love.
ross| i i do, i do not love rachel. im gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. okay? would i do that if i loved her?|phoebe| ive never been more convinced of your love for her.
ross| i do not have feelings for rachel! okay?! |ross| ohh, whats wrong?!
rachel| monica and chandler are really moving in here and i have to move out and everything is changing.|ross| oh mycome here! come here!  its okay. everythings gonna be okay.
rachel| thank you.|ross| of course.
joey| so, ross and rachel got married, monica and chandler almost got married, do you think you and i should hook up?|phoebe| oh we do, but not just yet.
joey| really?! well, when?|phoebe| okay umm, well, first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. yeah. but it wont work out.
joey| wow.|phoebe| i know. then, im gonna marry chandler for the money and youll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids.
joey| great!|phoebe| but then we ditch those two and thats when we get married. well have chandlers money and rachels kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachels drinking problem.
joey| oh-oh, what about ross?|phoebe| i dont want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and i kill him.
chandler|  hey!|phoebe| hey! check it out! this is unbelievable! joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes! 
joey|  dude! what are yoyou trying to kill me?!|rachel|  pheebs, i wanna ask you something.
phoebe| uh-huh, what?|rachel| well since im movin out and-and youre so beautiful
phoebe| oh!|rachel| how about i move in with you?
phoebe| well, that would be great but then what do we do about denise?|monica| whos denise?
phoebe| my roommate.|rachel| you have a roommate?!
phoebe| yes, denise. denise! |joey| hey, what is with the secrecy phoebe? huh? and what about this denise, is she cute?
chandler| pheebs, i dont understand. how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?|phoebe| maybe because you never listen to anything that i say. i talk about her all the time! denise!!!!!
joey| hey rach, listen i was thinkin uh, im gonna have an extra room over at my place|rachel| oh, thats true.
joey| yeah, why dont you move in with me? itll be great! we could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about naked thursdays right?|rachel| yeah, yeah i think im gonna find my own place.
chandler| hey-hey! i thought naked thursdays was just our thing man!|phoebe| hey.
ross| hey!|phoebe| so, what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
ross| oh, that. umm, she took it really well.|phoebe| you didnt tell her did you?
ross| no. |phoebe| of course not, because youre in love with her.
ross| i am not in love with her. she was very upset about having to move out so i eh, didnt tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. i-i just comforted her, as a friend.|phoebe| what do you mean, comforted her?
ross| its nothing, i just gave her a hug.|phoebe| ah-ha! a classic sign of love, the hug!
ross| its also a sign of friendship.|phoebe| yeah, not in your case lovey loverson. 
ross|  it was a hug!|phoebe| okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
ross| s-s-smell her hair? what if i did?|phoebe| ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of her head! thats why, thats why women are shorter. so that men will fall in love when they hug them!  oh come on ross, youre a scientist. 
ross| i was hugging her as a friend. its not my fault her-her hair got in my face, shes got a lot of it and it smells all-all uhcoconutty.  what?! oh, that doesnt mean i have feelings for rachel! maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts!|phoebe|  okay, whatever you say. but just be careful, all right? rachels not in the same place you are.
ross|  if the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place!|phoebe| okay, i didnt understand that, but yknow, maybe thats cause you were speaking the secret language of love! 
joey| hey!  dude, some guy just called for you.|chandler| who was it?
joey| i dont know! how about, \thanks for taking the message.\ jeez! |monica| okay listen, yknow when you move in rachels room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
chandler| sure!|monica| okay, i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! okay, whatever, i really havent thought about it that much.
chandler| well, i like that idea. obviously! i was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow? i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like space invaders and asteroids for $200, the real ones! the big-big ones!|monica| no.
chandler| okay so you mean no as in, \gee chandler, what an interesting idea. lets discuss it before we reject it completely.\|monica| oh, im sorry. of course i mean that. interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
chandler| so, thats it?|monica| i just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
chandler| which is why asteroids is perfect! its the oldest game!|monica| what do you have against the beautiful guest room?
chandler| i dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!|monica| are you mocking me?
chandler| no, im not mocking you, |joey| hey, whats up?
chandler| nothing, monica and i had a stupid fight.|joey| but youre still moving in together, right? because my ad came out today. 
chandler|  \wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly.\ nice!|joey| yeah? i just figured yknow, after living with you itd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, yknow? someone i can learn from, someone-someone whos different than me. and whats more different than me; a guy whos not 19 than say a girl who is 19? enh?  not just a hat rack my friend!
rachel| pheebs, i have to ask you|phoebe| shhhhhh! im swamped right now.
rachel| youre just staring into space.|phoebe| umm, im trying to move that pencil. 
rachel| this one? |phoebe| it worked!
rachel| pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! every place i can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. i mean, look at this;  \wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly.\ its just, there is nothing! the citys full!|phoebe| wait, no, look at this!  \two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, satan worshipers okay\ oh, yeah, but its on the ground floor.
ross|  hey!|rachel| hey.
ross| rach, uh, you still looking for a place?|rachel| yeah! why?
ross| okay, theres this guy, warren, from the museum and hes going on a dig for like two years and hes got this great place he needs to sublet. so uh, you interested?|rachel| that sounds great! id love to live at warrens!! i love warren! thank you!
ross| dont thank me! if you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.  heres warrens number.|rachel| oh, this is great! i am gonna call him right now!  oh, thank you! 
ross| okay, you go grab it!|phoebe| i saw it.
ross| i dont know what youre talking about.|phoebe| umm, im talking about that which you already know but wont admit. you love her again; you re-love her!
ross| look, i do not re-love her.|phoebe| i cant believe you wont just admit it!  okay, just promise me that you wont do anything stupid.
ross| look, were just friends now! okay? why would i do anything stupid?|rachel|  ugh!!! well, the apartment is already subletted! i mean, this is just hopeless. im never gonna find anything.
ross| you can live with me.|rachel| what?!
phoebe| what?!|ross| what?
rachel| oh my god! are you serious?!|ross| uh-huh. 
rachel| i would love to live with you ross; thats-thats great! thank you!|ross| well, im-im just glad i could, yknow, help you out.
phoebe| wow! im-im so happy for you guys.  this is so-so, not stupid.|rachel| ross-ross, you have no idea what this means to me! i mean, i mean i was gonna be homeless. you just saved me! youre my hero!
ross| hero, i uh, i dont knowwell, all right.|rachel| oh, i have to go tell monica what a wonderful brother she has!  
ross| oh please!  youre gonna say things now, arent ya?|phoebe| no. no, i wont. but i should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate denise. she moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! and thats how she ended up living with me!  okay, thats a lie.
chandler| hi.|monica| hi.
chandler| hi, listen, im sorry about before. i dont need to have a game room. i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i couldnt get girls, and now i can emnow, i have you.  not-not that i think that i have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, i see women|monica| stop it chandler.  im sorry too.
chandler| really?|monica| yeah! oh yes!
chandler| ohh.|monica| listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
chandler| thats a great idea! we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.|monica| totally!
chandler| we dont have to come up with this now.|monica| oh good.
chandler| hey, yknow what? why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room?|monica| changes?
chandler| yeah, i mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. |monica| youre-youre-youre gonna bring the barca lounger over here?
chandler| is that a problem?|monica| well, its a set and they should probably stay together.
chandler| oh, thats cool. then ill just bring them both over.|monica| see now-now youre taking them away from their home.
chandler| okay, i get it. so, i get nothing! nothing here is mine! everything here is yours! ill get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!|monica| yeah-yeah, yknow what? yeah, thats it-thats it, everything will be mine! nothing will be yours! thats-thats what i said! oh come on, chandler! im talking about the barca lounger! it just, it doesnt match! where is it gonna go?!
chandler| in the game room!|monica| look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
chandler| all right! thats fine! thats fine! i wont bring over the chairs! i wont bring anything over! i wouldnt want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandmas place!! |joey|  everything on your application looks really goodohh! just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
the potential roommate| oh dont worry, im not really a party girl.|joey| whoa!! now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. i want you to really think about your answers. okay?
chandler| |joey| oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but i dont think hes gonna get it.
chandler| why did you take the shower curtain down?|joey| that thing was a hazard!  im very safety conscious.
rachel| hey!|ross| hey! oh listen, i was just clearing some space for your stuff.
rachel| oh thanks, but listen, i was just at monicas and she and chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.|ross| what do you mean, theyre not moving in? they-theyre still moving in right?
rachel| no-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.|ross| what?! over a stupid room!
rachel| yeah, i feel kinda bad for them, but im also really psyched cause i dont have to move in here!|ross| oh no, yeah no, that parts great!
ross| whats all this about you guys fighting?! is this really over a room?! i mean, that is so silly!|monica| ross, we can handle this.
ross| well, apparently not, and i cant just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. i mean, enough of the silliness!|chandler| well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly! 
ross|  okay-okay! two very good points, look ive known you both a long time, and ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together. do you really want to throw that all away over a room? that is so silly. now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?|chandler| well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
monica| love is the best medicine.|chandler| thats laughter.
monica| why do you do it?|chandler| i dont know.
ross| okay! all right! now, chandler you-you wanna live with monica, right?|chandler| yeah, i do.
ross| and mon, you wanna live with chandler, dont ya?|monica| yes.
ross| |gunther| so i understand youre looking for a place.
rachel| no-no, im staying put.|gunther| oh, i was going to offer you my apartment.
rachel| why, where are you going?|gunther| i dont know.
ross|  hey rach!|rachel| hi!
ross| youre never gonna believe it uh, monica and chandler are moving in again. thats great news righti mean for them. right?|rachel| oh wow.
ross| yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.|rachel| yeah. yknow umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, ross i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but dont you think its gonna be weird?
ross| wh-why?! why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?|rachel| well, because of us! because of our history.
ross| no!|rachel| no?
ross| no! no! it would be weird if we were still in that place, i mean are you still in that place?|rachel| no! not at all!
ross| good! me neither! so its not a problem. were just two friends who happen to be roommates.|rachel| okay, but ross, eventually you and i are gonna be dating.
ross| really?! we are?|rachel| yeah! im gonna have a boyfriend, youre gonna have a girlfriend
ross| ohh! that would be great.|rachel| but yknow what, if you think its gonna be okay well just work out a system. yknow, itll be like college, ill hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, \come back later, im gettin lucky.\ 
ross|  yeah, i didnt think of that.|ross| so are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! i mean its a really big step! and-and whats the rush?!
monica| thats very funny!|chandler| hes being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
ross| no, i-i-im serious, okay? i mean, think about it. you move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing yknow you break up!|monica| ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
ross| okay, there are no stupid fights!! this isnt about the room, this is about what the roomrepresents! and unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!!|chandler| yeah, i'm not so worried.
monica| yeah, no, me neither.|ross| fine! its your life! 
monica| you still want to move in together right?|chandler| of course!
monica| ross didnt scare you?|chandler| scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
monica| come here, i want to show you something!|chandler| okay!
chandler| oh my god! someones killed square man!|monica| this is where i thought the barca lounger could go! you see you could see the tv and its still walking distance to the kitchen.
chandler| oh thats so sweet! i want to show you something too!|monica| okay!
chandler| yknow those big-big uh, road signs that say \merge?\|monica| uh-hmm.

monica| youre kidding!|phoebe|  oh my god!!

chandler| okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?|ross| rach, come on, if you think about it, its actually kinda funny.  okay, maybe its best not to think about it.
phoebe| okay, this is inexcusable. i am shocked to my very core!|ross| phoebe, i told her you already knew.

joey|  its got em!|rachel| so, i still have boxes here. i still have boxes at rosss, and i have nowhere to live! wow. i could so easily freak out right now.
phoebe| what about me? i just found out that denise is leaving town for a while, i dont have a roommate.|rachel| well, maybe-maybe i could be your roommate pheebs.
phoebe| maybe you could be my roommate!|rachel| well theres an idea!!
phoebe| yeah!|rachel| that would be great! wait, how long is denise gone for?
phoebe| umm, she said shed be back december 26th. |rachel| december 26th, huh maybe shes santa clause.
rachel|  oh look who it is, my husband. the apple of my eye.|ross| okay, i got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and i picked up all the forms. ill take care of everything.
rachel| well sure, if you say youre gonna take care of everything i have no reason to doubt you. give me those forms!  all right, now im gonna do this my way and i dont want to hear a peep out of you!|ross| okay rach, but
rachel| op! youre peeping!|rachel| ross! yknow what, i just gotwhy? why did you do this?!
ross| look i told you|rachel| i dont wanna hear \three failed marriages!\
ross| look, if youd had two failed marriages, youd understand!|rachel| well, yknow what? thanks to you im half way there! ugh! oh! i am so mad! ross, i dont think i have ever been this angry!
ross| what about the time i said we were on a break?|rachel| ugh! 
monica| pheebs, hows it going?|phoebe|  im doing okay. i think its going well. do you think theyre having fun? am i talking to fast?
monica| nope, sound like me. pheebs, its going great. look at chandler with little baby girl chandler.|chandler| little baby girl chandler, where i have heard that before? oh right, coach ruben. 
phoebe| na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.|chandler| see thats where i think that youre wrong. weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
monica| what do you mean?|chandler| i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. and yknow mon, you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around 
phoebe| that sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.|chandler| okay, im a rookie. i should not be in the end zone.
monica| this is so great! this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.|phoebe| yeah?  well this is not what i ordered.
joey|  hey guys!|chandler| hey!
phoebe| hey!|joey| hey babies! oh, im having the best morning. that uh, that porsche ive got the keys too, still there!
chandler| shocking! since you still have the keys.|joey| you should see the treatment i get when im with that car! people are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! one guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
chandler| what equity investments?|joey| the ones that got me the porsche! will you keep up!  but i figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, theyre gonna start to think that i dont own it. so i figured ill wash it. right? monica, you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow?
monica| oh yeah, i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound.|chandler| you dont even have a car!
monica| i know. but umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so i washed it.|chandler| and?
monica| and six others.|chandler| there you are.
joey| yeah, she tops out at 130.|joey| and thats just in the city. i get her up to 160 when i take her upstate.
joey| sure!|joey| okay, take it easy.
the porsche owner| hey! thats my car.|joey| really? oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
the porsche owner| what-what are you doing?|joey| oh i-i uh, found the keys and now im just polishing her up.
the porsche owner| but its my car!|joey| yeah, but its my wax.
the porsche owner| listen, i-i-i dont come to this city much so i dont know if youre crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could i have my keys.|joey| sure. here.  ill uh, save your parking spot.
the porsche owner| im not coming back.|joey| why not?
the porsche owner| i live upstate.|joey| yeah, so did i.
phoebe| i dont know why i was so nervous about this. and i dont know why frank and alice are always complaining. this is so easy.|monica| yeah, two hours, a lifetime thats the same.
chandler| |monica| chandler, what are you doing? that thing can put someones eye out!
chandler| he can do more than that! he can destroy the universe!|phoebe| no chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! and also, look at his smooth area, thats just gonna mess them up.
chandler| theyre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. when i was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!|phoebe| what?!
chandler| glass, sand, whatever. |phoebe| oh, look at little leslie stretching in her sleep.
monica| oh its so cute. i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.|phoebe| oh, i can still do that.
monica| how are you still single?!|chandler|  i thought about it and maybe youre right. maybe krog is not a safe toy.
monica| good. what made you change your mind?|chandler| i swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
phoebe| how did that happen?!!|chandler| well, i was trying to prove that i was right. yknow? and it turns out i was wrong. and now its lodged in my throat. 
monica| damnit! yknow this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching chandler! |judge| okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
rachel| yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.|judge| so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr. geller is mentally unstable.
ross| fine, im mentally unstable.|judge| and based on the fact that mr. geller is intravenous drug user.
ross| what?!|rachel| uh yes, heroin and crack.
ross| crack isnt even an intravenous drug!|rachel| well, you would know.
judge| now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?|ross| oh, come on!
rachel|  ross, please, i found the magazines!|judge| and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. well, that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin.
ross| okay, im sorry, this is insane! i-i-im not addicted to heroin, im not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! look, ill consummate this marriage right here, right now!|judge| that wont be necessary.
ross| and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!|rachel| ugh!
judge| now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.|rachel| ross! your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!  and could you strike \consummated like bunnies\ from the record?
judge| is there, anything in this record that is actually true?|rachel| well, yes, we got married in vegas and uh, and the names i think.
judge| well, based on what i heard, you two certainly dont qualify for an annulment. if you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce.|ross|  thats great! are you happy now? look what you did with your funny, funny form!
rachel|  what?! me?! what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!|ross| and what stop typing! stop typing!!
rachel|  okay, do you see, do you see what youre keeping me married too?!|judge| you need to get out of my chambers.
rachel| all right look lady here is the deal, i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one!|ross| yeah!
judge| would you like to spend the night in jail?|rachel| and thank you for your time. 
joey|  so the porsche guy took his car back.|chandler| but you found the keys to his clothes?
joey| no. no, i just uh, i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche.|monica| and people will think you own a porsche because youre wearing the clothes?
joey| of course! only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! right?|chandler| that is true.
phoebe| yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.|joey| oh, ive been there. yeah, i am gonna go drive my porsche. 
monica| joey, you know you dont actually have one.|joey| come on! what are you doing?! im in character! would you talk to her! 
chandler| ahh, i think it just moved. its really poking me.|monica| all right, thats it, were going to the emergency room.
phoebe| what?! no, you cant, you cant leave me here with them! were baby-sitting! |monica| the babies are asleep, im sure youll be okay on your own for a while!
phoebe| but you-you cant leave me with them! we-were a team! were playing a zone! theyre gonna triple team me!|monica| hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital.
phoebe| but no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.|chandler| i think thats gum.
phoebe| im pretty sure its gun.|chandler| okay, listen this really hurts. lets go.
phoebe| a real man wouldnt just run to the hospital! |joey| why isnt that valet back with my porsche?
passerby| maybe because youve got the keys?|joey|  porsche.
rachel| this is totally your fault!|ross| my fault?! you threatened the judge!
rachel| well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine!!|ross| that was the only way i could get him to stop typing!
joey| hi! how are the gellers? |rachel| dont call us that! 
ross| the judge wouldnt let us get an annulment! now we gotta get a divorce!! did a porsch throw up on you? |joey| hey! its porsche!! 
phoebe| me taking care of you is no problem, huh? you guys feel safe. right? okay, im gonna take that spit bubble as, \yeah, i do!\ okay, after i get rid of this dirty diaper leslie, ill set you up with a clean one. |chandler|  hey!
phoebe|  how do you feel?|chandler| well, lets just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
phoebe| okay, so i totally took care of the babies all by myself! i fed em, bathed em, and put em to bed.|chandler| and protected them from a tornado?
monica| oh my god.|phoebe| i know, the babies are asleep.
monica| phoebe, what, what happened here?!|phoebe| i did it! i took care of the babies all by myself!
monica| but my apartment!|chandler| was the setting of phoebes triumph.
monica| but the mess!|chandler| is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
monica| youre right, youre right i shouldnt freak out. cause this is what will happen when you and i have babies! when will that be?!|chandler|  phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
rachel|  oh honey thank god youre home, i was getting worried.|ross| i picked up the divorce papers. uh, ive already signed everything and i put little xs where you need to sign.
rachel| oh, little xs! great! that makes up for everything!|ross| yknow, i-iyouve done a lot of stupid stuff too! okay?
rachel| oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!|ross| okay, how about you flew to london to stop my wedding! ah, how about you told me you loved me after i was already married!
rachel| hey! wait a minute! that was different! i did those things because i was in love with you!|ross| yeah! right!
ross| youre right. thats very different. so lets, lets just sign the papers. all right?  what?|rachel| nothing. 
ross| okay, can we just sign please?|rachel| uh-hmm. 
ross| congratulations. |rachel| okay ross, werewait a minute. umm, i uh, i kinda have a little confession.
ross| what?|rachel| well, yknow this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
ross| excuse me?|rachel| well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
ross| yeah?|rachel| and uh, yeah, i didnt really, i didnt want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. and uh, and i thought it would be funnier if we got married. so as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then  to eat a lot of grapes. so umm, sorry i got us into this mess.
ross| so then if-ifi mean if you think about it, this is all  your fault.|rachel| yeah, dont push it though.
ross| ive got to say; i know i divorce a lot of women, never thought i would be divorcing you.|rachel| i know. i always thought if you and i got married, it would be the one that stuck. and it wouldnt be a secret, and we wouldnt have our wedding dinner at pizza hut. 
ross| did i, did i even treat?|rachel| no, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
ross| that may be the most depressing thing ive heard in my life. i should probably get these to my lawyers office.|rachel| hey, thanks ross, for taking care of all of this.
ross| eh, no problem.|rachel| im gonna need a copy of those.
ross| totally. |joey| hey! hey! be careful around my porsche!

phoebe| well, how much do you think he needs?|chandler| i figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yknow? but i have to trick him into taking it so i wont hurt his pride.
phoebe| why dont you hire him as an actor? you could have him dress up and put on little skits. whatever you want.|chandler| well that would help the pride thing.

joey| over there!  before, with the bills! you tried to give some charity, i said \no,\ you dropped it. okay? then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!|chandler| im just trying to help you out! okay? i wanna make sure that youre okay.

chandler| she is gonna recognize that i did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.|ross| hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. cause when you have to move back in with joey, joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
chandler| i see, i see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.|ross| look chandler, monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. believe me, i lived with her for 16 years. she is going to freakout. oh my god, she's going to sit on you.

chandler| oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.|monica| it's worse. the only thing that's getting me through is knowing that i'm gonna be seeing you soon. i think i may even try to get out of here early.

chandler| it's, all good! okay bye-bye mon!  she's-she's gonna kill me.|ross| yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  and that goes back up there.
chandler| we should start with the big stuff. yknow? that'll be the easiest. uh, let's start with the couch. |ross| yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
chandler| what are you talking about? the couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. and then i can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... ok, ok, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.|ross| whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
chandler| ok well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.|ross| whoa, whoa, whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
chandler| yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...rooosss!!!!|joey|  monica's gonna kill you! look i need your help, i have to do something to-to repel this woman! wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time. 
ross| hey, i've been married 3 times|joey| no-no-no i've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. what's your secret?
ross| look, we do not repel women ok? that is completely untrue.|chandler| oh no, yes we do my man. remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the irish potato famine?
ross| yeah, well what about you? you weren't you know, so hot in college either. after everything he said, he'd go \ba dum bum chessh\ |chandler| yeah, monica doesn't like that either, maybe i should stop doing that. 
ross| oh y'know what, girls don't like it when i start talking about science.|chandler| that's not specific to girls.
joey| this is great, this is great, what else, what else?|ross| uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
chandler| and they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.|ross| they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
chandler| man, i'm so lucky i have monica.|ross|  i'm never gonna find love again.
rachel| hey phoebe, can i talk to you for a second?|phoebe| sure 
rachel| okay, um, i... all right phoebe look, i just wanted to say that i'm sorry. ok? i handled the situation horribly and i should not have lied to you. |phoebe| so, what should you have done?
rachel| well, i-i should've told you the truth.|phoebe| uh-huh, which is...?
rachel| well, y'know, the reason i didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...|phoebe| so?
rachel| well, it's embarrassing. people were looking at us like we were crazy.|phoebe| why do you care?
rachel| because they're people.|phoebe| but people that you don't know and will never see again.
rachel| yes, but still. they're peoplewith eyes.|phoebe| well, i didn't get embarrassed running next to miss . but no, okay. no, no, i can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. yeah, okay. you're uptight.
rachel| i-i am not uptighthey-hey-hey-oh-oh! listen, i am not uptight, man.|phoebe| that's okay rachel. i'm not judging you; that's just who you are. me. i'm more free y'know? i run like i did when i was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. y'know, i mean didnt you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from satan?  the neighbor's dog.
chandler| okay, is this lamp in the same place?|ross| who cares? i repel women.
chandler|  no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! you can't come in here! r-r-r-r-ross is naked.|monica| what?!
ross|  what?!|chandler|  i couldn't say that i was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
ross| why does anyone have to be naked?|monica| why is ross naked?
ross| i-i had to show chandler something?|monica| naked?
ross| yeah-yeah i uh, i have a uh, a guy problem.|monica| is it the same thing that chandler had?
chandler| look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.|monica| okay, listen, there's still some of chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. bye!
chandler| bye! thank god|ross| dude, what'd you have?
chandler| look, we have no time okay? we must focus. we gotta get everything back into its original place.|ross|  the photo album! there were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. we just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
chandler| that's perfect! that's brilliant! |ross| so really, what'd ya have?
janine| hey joey, i got some beer for you.|joey| uh, don't you mean \for whom?\
janine| sure, listen i was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?|joey| pizza, heh, its not like i never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
janine| is there something wrong?|joey| all right, all right, let's just get this out in the open okay? you're hot. i'm lovable. clearly there's a vibe going on between us. but, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
janine| joey...|joey| no, no, no, i'm telling ya. imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? so the question is, what do we do?
janine| well, i don't think there is anything to do. i mean i think you're really sweet, but i'm just not interested in you like that.|joey| oh!
janine| no! i mean you're a really nice guy and i'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, i'm just y'know, i just don't feel that way about you.|joey| oh! i see what happened. it's because i was trying to repel you. right? believe me, you'd feel a lot different if i turned it on.
janine| i don't think so.|joey| oh, i do.  how you doin?
janine| i'm ok|joey| what?!?!
janine| what?|joey| oh dear god!
rachel|  hey!|phoebe| hey!
rachel| oh honey, i'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!|phoebe| see? and you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
rachel| gone! i mean its amazing pheebs. i feel so free and so graceful. |monica| is it okay for me to come in now?
chandler| uh-huh|monica| why is everything different?
ross| bye! |chandler| no, i don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. 
monica| well, the end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.|chandler| okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? but after i unpacked the boxes i wanted to do something nice for you, so, i-i-i cleaned the apartment. so i moved everything around and then i forgot where it, where it went back and i'm sorry, i'm very sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry.
monica| it's okay. chandler, are you afraid of me or something? |chandler| do you want me to be afraid of you?
monica| of course not. i mean gosh, chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and i really appreciate it. i know i have this weird thing where i want everything to be in the perfect place, but i'd never expect you to worry about that.|chandler| really?
monica| of course!|chandler| oh well you're the best. you come here to me.
monica| all right, hold on okay? first thing's first.  okay, now did ross sit anywhere while he was naked?|ross| so it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. so theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
janine| ...and live forever as a machine!|ross| that's so janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? you and i, we're interfacing.
janine| yeah, i gotta go.|chandler| ba dum bumb cheshhh!
joey| hey.|chandler| hi, my names chandler. i just moved in next door and i was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?

joey| uh, no, shes at dance class.|chandler| can i check out what she did to my room?

rachel| okay, two things didnt happen. remember i told you that someone made out with ralph lauren in the copy room? well, it turns out thats not true.|kim| thats not true?
rachel| no.|kim| oh thats interesting? because i checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, rachel.
rachel| oh no, no, no. oh god, you think i made out with him.|kim| listen to me. if you think sleeping with ralph is going to get you my job. you are sadly mistaken.
rachel| i-i dont want your job. i-i dont. ohh this is such a mistake. i did not make out with him. nobody made out with him. i did not use my keycard yesterday. i dont even know how to use my keycard. |kim| hi ralph.
ralph lauren|: hi kim. |kim| yeah, nothing happen. you could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
hillary| and after that, what could i do except become a chef.|ross| mmm-hmm.
hillary| and someday soon, i hope to open my own restaurant.|ross| mmm.
hillary| you know, youre a really great listener. most guys i go out with, they just talk and talk.|ross| mm-hmm.
hillary| after a while its like, shut your mouth, you know?|ross|  hmm-hmm.
hillary| ive probably been talking too much. why dont we talk about you a little bit?|ross| mmm-unmm.
hillary| come on. i want to know.|ross| hmm-hmm-hmm.  okay. i, uh, am from long island. i-i came to the city for college. um, i, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time i like to read spy novels. but, but, lets talk more about you. hmm.
joey| so whats really neat. if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.|monica| oh my god, joey, that is such a great tip.
chandler| monica, could you excuse us for a second? i need to talk to the girl with the flowers.|monica| okay. oh but joey, come over later because im going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
joey| ohh, i love birds. |chandler| what is the matter with you ?!?
joey| what?|chandler| youre arranging flowers!  you got dead flowers! you got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! this is not joey!!

joey| no im not. why would you say that? thats just mean.|chandler| now ive upset you? what did i say?
joey| its not what you said. its the way you said it.oh my god, im a women!!!|rachel| now, she thinks that i made out with him and i did it to get her job.
phoebe| but why didnt you just tell her the truth.|rachel| i did but she doesnt think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse kenny the copy guy with ralph lauren.
phoebe| well, hey, what if kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? you know. what if kenny hired that ralph lauren guy to be the pretty front man? huh, did she ever think of that?|rachel| you were with kenny today, werent you?
phoebe| just for a second.|rachel| ohh, phoebe, what am i going to do?
phoebe| well, the only thing you can do. sleep with ralph lauren.|rachel| im not going to sleep with ralph lauren. i mean, i could, but i wouldnt.
phoebe| ohh, sleep with kenny.|rachel| that wouldnt help me.
phoebe| ohh, yes it would.|hillary| ive had a really good time tonight.
ross| mmm.|hillary| you know, i rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
ross| |hillary| are you going to eat that bread?
ross|  mmmm.|hillary|  you make me laugh.
ross| hmm-hmm.|hillary| would you like to move over to the couch?
ross| mmm-hmm. |hillary| maybe ill just turn the lights down a little.

kim| you expect me to believe.. hi ralph.|ralph lauren|: hi kim. 
kim| oh my god. he just gave you the coldest look i have ever seen. its like he hates you. then it is true.|rachel| of course its true and it hurts so bad.
kim| ohh honey come here.  ohh it will be ok. weve all been there.|rachel| you and ralph?
kim| kenny the copyboy.|janine| hey.
joey| hey, uhh, i need to talk to you.|janine| whats the matter? are you upset?
joey| im sorry but weve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. i, uh, i got to be a man! okay. the living room has to remain a guy place, okay? thats just the way it has to be.|janine| well, if thats what you want. ill just put it all in my room.
joey| greatgreatand thanks for being so understanding. i mean, i didnt want to make a big deal out of this, you know.  you could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. i mean, if you want to.|janine| okay.
joey| and, uhh, maybe the watering can there.|janine| sure.
joey| and a couple of these little tiny boxes.|janine| joey? do you want me to put it all in your room?
chandler| sydney portier? hehheh.|monica|  no, my parents.
chandler| oh! thats great, they havent seen the place since i moved in!|monica| yeah, and yknow, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , i was thinking we would eat around four.
chandler|  why cant i tell them that we live together?|monica| because they dont know were dating. 
chandler| why havent you told them?!|monica| um, well, i was going to, i-i-i really was. but um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, i didnt.
chandler| why havent you told them?! wouldnt they be happy?!|monica| 
chandler| why wouldnt they be happy?|monica| well, um, because mainly, um, they dont like you. im sorry.
chandler| what? what? why?!|monica| maybe because you used to be aloof, or that youre really sarcastic, or that, yknow, you joke around all the time. or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
chandler| is this why they dont like me or why you dont like me?|monica| look, i know that i shouldve told them. i know i shouldnt care what they think. im sorry. 
chandler| yknow, itll be okay. itll be okay. because when they come over, i will be all charming, i will make them fall in love with me, and then well tell em.|monica| you really think thatll work?
chandler| hey, i can be pretty charming, babe, i won you over, didnt i?|monica|  i dont think youll ever get my parents that drunk! 
chandler| hey!  oh, good, ross! youre parents like me, right?|ross|  yes, of course they like you!
chandler| well monica just told me that they dont.|ross|  yeah, they dont like you.
chandler|  do you know why?|ross| i dunno, maybe its because youre really sarcastic. or maybe its cause you uh-
chandler|  well if people dont know they shouldnt just guess!|chandler| this is great, another thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.

chandler| yeah, ross sure is a great guy, yknow ive always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.|mr. geller| i always thought that too. tell me, what does your father do?
chandler|  hes the headliner of a gay burlesque show.|joey| rach, youre killin us here, will ya serve the dessert already? those drunken dancers are waiting! 
rachel|  look at it, isnt it beautiful?|ross| yeah, yeah, what is it?
rachel| its a truffle. its got all of these layers. first theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which i made from scratch,  then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then i just put some whipped cream on top!|ross| w-what was the one right before bananas?
rachel| the beef? yeah, that was weird to me, too. but then, yknow, i thought well, theres mincemeat pie, i mean thats an english dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, yknow.  oh! by the way, can i borrow some rum from your place?|joey| y-sure!
rachel|  and while im gone dont you boys sneak a taste.|joey and ross|  okay.
ross| beef in a dessert?! i- no no no, there is no way!|joey| i know, and only one layer of jam?! what is up with that?
ross| oh my god, the pages are stuck together!|joey|  chandler!
ross| oh my god, she-she made half a english trifle, and half a...sheperds pie!|joey|  oh man! now shes gonna start all over! were never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
ross| no, no, we will. we just wont tell her she messed up.|joey| just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
ross| yeah, itll be like a funny thanksgiving story!|joey|  vomiting stories are funny...
rachel| joey, god, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!|joey| did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
rachel| no!|joey|  still not hot enough!
phoebe| rachel?|rachel| yeah?

mr. geller| whats the matter with him?|mrs. geller|  i think hes stoned again.
chandler|  what?|monica|  what?
ross|  dude, i need to talk to you a sec.|ross| okay, i think i might know why my parents dont like you.
chandler| you do? why?|ross| okay, remember, we were young. hey, spring break, sophomore year, i got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so i told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
chandler| what?! why did you do that?|ross| i dont know, aheh, yours was the first name that-that popped into my head, im im sorry. i-i didnt think it would matter.
chandler| how could it not matter?!|ross| how was i supposed to know wed end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
chandler| what about all that friends forever stuff?|ross| i dont know, i-i was all high. 
monica| mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get ross stoned!|chandler| your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
monica| ross, i cant believe youd do that!|chandler| the reason we havent told them were together is because they hate me, okay? so will you fix this?
ross| okay, okay, ill tell em it wasnt chandler who got high. now who should i say it was?|monica| you! its not like its a big deal! you-you dont still do it or anything!
ross| alright, alright, now-now who should i say tricked me into doing it?|monica| dad, please dont pick your teeth out here! alright, and if youre gonna put your feet up, why dont you sit on the-
phoebe| monica, leave him alone!|joey|  will you hurry up? did you not hear me before when i told you that all of janines friends are dancers?! and that theyre going to be drinking alot!?
rachel|  no, i did, but tell me again, because its so romantic.|joey| well youre whippin so slow! cant you do it any faster?
rachel| joey! come on! i dont wanna make any mistakes, alright? this is the only dessert and if i screw it up everybody's gonna be like oh, remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle?|rachel| so why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
joey| oh i am!|monica| ross, if you dont tell them, then i will!
ross| okay, fine!|joey| ross! can i talk to you for a second?
ross| oh, uh, can it wait a second joey? i have to tell my parents something. no it cant? okay.|joey| okay, look, i think we have to tell rachel she messed up her dessert.
ross| what?! what is with everybody? its thanksgiving, not...truth-day!|joey| look, when everyone eats that...that...banana-meat thing, theyre all gonna make fun of her, do you want that?
ross| okay, okay, well just get everyone to act like they like it. that-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to sweet potatoe pie! |joey|  dude, theyre not objects.
joey| just kiddin, ill talk to them, you distract rach.|ross| hey rach, can i talk to you outside for a second?
rachel| okay...|rachel| whats up, ross?

ross| and um...you look nice today.|rachel| oh no. no ross, dont do this.
ross| what?|rachel| i just- i dont think us getting back together is a good idea.
ross|  eh?|rachel| i thought this might happen today. ross, i know the holidays can be rough. yknow? and its probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
ross|  youre alone.|rachel| no, i-i live with phoebe. i mean youre  alone, alone. and i just-its just not the time for us. im sorry.
ross|  ah well, cant blame a guy for trying!|joey| oh and , okay?
chandler| yeah, im not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.|joey| rachel, there you are! come on, lets serve that dessert already!
rachel| joey, youre gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? you dont get any dessert.|joey|  really?
rachel| no, im just kidding i would never do that to you! okay, everybody, its trifle time!|phoebe| so, now, rach, this is a traditional english trifle, isnt it?
rachel| it sure is.|phoebe| wow. so then did you make it with beef or eggplant?
rachel| beef.|phoebe| i cant have any. you know i dont eat meat.  ohhh no.
rachel| alright, monica, i want you to have the first taste.|monica| really?
rachel| oh oh oh, wait! you only got whipped cream in there! ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!|monica| okay.
rachel| op! wait, you dropped a pea.|rachel| well?
monica|  mmmm! its good!|rachel| really? how good? 
monica| its so good, that i feel really selfish about being the only one whos eating it, that i think we should have everyone taste how good it is. especially ross.|all|  mmm.
chandler|  yeah, this is so good, that im gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that i can enjoy the view whilst i enjoy my dessert.|mrs. geller|  ive gotta call my friend mary and tell her how good this is, from monicas room.
mr. geller|  ill help you dial.|monica|  im gonna go into the bathroom so i can look at it in the mirror, as i eat it.
rachel| okay, now what was that all about? is it-does it not taste good? let me try it.|ross| wha? no no! ah!  all gone! so good! maybe chandler has some left.
ross| it tastes like feet!|joey| i like it.
ross| are you kidding?|joey| whats not to like? custard? good. jam? good. meat? gooooood.
rachel| ...so a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?|chandler|  yes, but if its any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
phoebe| rachel, come here.  okay, i was just starting to take my thanksgiving nap, and i had another dream about jack.|rachel| oh, phoebe, do i wanna hear this?
phoebe| i dunno, lets see! so, okay, i dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. and, um, so okay, i went to a night club, and i saw him making out with a girl.|rachel|  oh my god, he dream-cheated on you!
phoebe| yeah, but then jacques cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! it was soo cool! then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.|mr. geller| boy, im glad i wore the big belt today.
phoebe| five minutes ago, a line like that wouldve floored me. now nothing. well, not nothing, i am still a woman.|monica| ross? lets go.
ross| oh yeah, about telling mom and dad, i was thinking about maybe writing a letter.|monica| alright, you know what? thats it. youve had your chance.
ross| wha-what?|monica|  mom! dad! ross smoked pot in college!
mr. and mrs. geller| what?!|ross|  you are such a tattletale! mom, dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
mr. and mrs. geller| yes. |ross| well i told you it was chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. im sorry.
mrs. geller| it was you?|monica| and dad, yknow that mailman that you got fired? he didnt steal your playboys! ross did!
ross| yeah, well, hurricane gloria didnt break the porch swing, monica did!|monica| ross hasnt worked at the museum for a year!
ross| monica and chandler are living together!|monica| ross married rachel in vegas! and got divorced! again!!!!
phoebe|  i love jacques cousteau!|rachel|  i wasnt supposed to put beef in the trifle!
joey|  i wanna gooooooo!|mrs. geller|  monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
mr. geller| and we kinda figured about the porch swing.|mrs. geller| ross, drugs? divorced? again?
mr. geller| what happened son?|ross| i-i uh, i got tricked into all those things!
mrs. geller| chandler! youve been rosss best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems.  and now youve taken on monica as well. well, i dont know what to say. youre a wonderful human being.|chandler| thank you!
mr. geller| no! thank you!  monica, and ross! i dont know what im gonna do about the two of you!|chandler|  ill talk to them! 
rachel| you guys! it was bananas, cream, and beef! i-i just cannot believe that you ate that so that i wouldnt feel bad!|monica| well actually, i-i didnt eat mine. its still in the bathroom.
joey| no it isnt, i ate that.|mrs. geller|  well we left ours in monicas bedroom.
rachel| thats a good story, grandpa.|ross| hey
all| hey|ross| wow, monicas letting other people help decorate her tree! did someone get her drunk again or?
monica| having a perfectly decorated tree is not what christmas is about. its about being with the people that you love.|phoebe| that is nice and were done. tada!
chandler| i dunno what it is, it just doesnt quite feel like christmas to me.|monica| oh, here.
chandler| see now it feels like christmas!|ross|  and thats the story of the dreidle. now, some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising lifes triumph over death. and that was like 4000 years ago.
rachel| so, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.|joey| hey you guys.
chandler| hey joe whats up?|joey| i had to get out of the apartment. janine is like stretching all over the place. yknow, everywhere i look shes like 
chandler| i can see why thats hard to resist.|joey| i like her so much!
monica| aw, im sorry sweetie that she doesnt feel the same way.|joey| i know. and shes so sweet. i just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
chandler| you are aware that shes not a monkey, right?|ross| i am so over janine. i mean, yeah, at first i thought she was hot, but now shes like old news!
janine| hey guys!|ross| hi janine!

rachel| well, thats a lot better than ross trying to kiss me in high school, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.|ross| it was a dry day.
monica| we are going to dick clarks new years rocking eve!|ross| oh my god!
monica| oh my god!|chandler|  oh my god!

phoebe| oh, i want to look too! . yikes!|monica| so do you think that these picturesare, are they trying to tell a story?
rachel| oh, yeah, sure. i mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, shes crying out, where are they, where are they?|monica| well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
phoebe| oh, yeah. aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?|rachel and monica| yeah.
rachel| you see, now, i would date this girl. shes cute, shes outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. i mean, thats got to come in handy|monica| okay, ive got a question. if you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
rachel|  i dont know.|monica| me neither.
phoebe| rachel.|monica| what?!
phoebe| i dont know.  me neither.|joey| you forget how many great songs heart had.
chandler| yeah.|ross| you know, barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard.
chandler| so, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.|joey| oh, you guys, with this joke. i gotta say, i know i cracked up, but im not even sure i got it.
ross| what, you didnt get it? the doctor is a monkey.|chandler| and monkeys cant write out prescriptions.
chandler|  you are not allowed to laugh at my joke.|ross| your joke? well, i think the hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
chandler| so, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.|ross| well, i was going to stick it in the atm, but now i think ill show the sexy teller that i am a published writer.
chandler| well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.|ross| oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
chandler| yeah!|ross| well, im not going to go now anyway .
chandler| okay .|gunther|  here you go.
joey| ah, gunther, i cant pay for this right now because im not working, so ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff.|gunther| well, if you want, you can work here.
joey| uh, i dont know. ya see, its just, see i was a regular on a soap opera yknow? and to go from that to this, i just plus, id have to wait on all my friends.|gunther| okay, but the moneys good, plus you get to stare at rachel as much as you want.
joey| what?!|gunther| flexible hours.
joey| maybe i could be a waiter. could i use the phone?|monica|  she picked rachel. i mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. she picked rachel.
chandler|  he took my joke, he took it. |monica| its wrong. you know what else is wrong? phoebe picking rachel.
chandler| you know who else picked rachel? ross, and you know what else ross did? he stole my joke. you know what? im going to get a joke journal. yknow? and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.|monica| thats a good idea. 
chandler| yeah!|monica| do you know whats a bad idea?
chandler| picking rachel.|monica| thats right.  did you hear something?
chandler| maybe its the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.|monica| its coming from the living room.
joey| |monica|  hey, you guys.
phoebe and rachel| hey.|monica|  oh, dont you guys look cute. you guys make such a cute couple.
rachel| monica, what are you doing?|monica|  remember, when you picked rachel over me? that was funny.
phoebe| i guess it was kinda funny.|monica|  it wasnt funny at all! why would you do that? why didnt you pick me?
phoebe| fine. the reason that i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you is just that youre  just  kinda high maintenanceokay lets go to lunch!|monica| that is completely untrue. you think im high maintenance? okay, prove it. i want you to make a list and were going to go through it point by point!
phoebe| no, okay, youre right. youre easy-going. youre just not as easy-going as rachel. shes just more flexible and-and mellow. thats all.|rachel|  well, people are different.
phoebe| ya, you know, rachel  shell do whatever you want. yknow, you can just walk all over her.|rachel| what? wait a minute. what are you saying, that im a pushover? im not a pushover.
phoebe| oh, okay,  youre not a pushover.|rachel| oh my  you think im a pushover. well wait, watch this, you know what? youre not invited to lunch. what do you think of that? i think thats pretty strong, thats what i think. come on, monica, lets go to lunch.

joey| its kind of embarrassing, yknow. i mean, i was an actor and now im a waiter. its supposed to go in the other direction.|chandler| so is your apron. youre wearing it like a cape.
joey| i mean, the jobs easy and the moneys good, you know? i guess im going to be hanging out here anyway. i might as well get paid for it, right? i just feel kind of weird serving you guys.|rachel| come on, joey, i did it and it was fine.
ross| yeah, why would it be weird? hey, joey, can i get some coffee?|joey| okay, i guess it doesnt seem that weird.
ross| seriously, i-i asked you before and you still havent gotten it.|joey| see, now its weird again.

joey| oh, im sorry, ross. ill get it for you right now. and since i made you wait, ill toss in a free muffin.|rachel| phoebe. we would like to talk to you for a second.
phoebe| okay.|monica| so, maybe i am a little high maintenance. and maybe rachel is a little bit of a pushover. but you know what we decided you are?
rachel| yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, phoebe, are flaky.|monica| hah!
phoebe| that true, i am flaky.|rachel| so, what, youre just, youre just okay with being flaky?

gunther| okay, ill see you in an hour.|joey| oh, man, i could totally get that part. im sorry, that seat is taken.
patron| oh, excuse me.|joey| no, no, i didnt mean you. but, you believed me, huh?
patron| i believed you were saving this seat for someone.|joey| so, youd hire me, right?
patron| for what?|joey| exactly! all right, everybody, listen up. the coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour. 
customers| huh? what?|joey| yeah, its for the kids. to keep the kids off drugs. its a very important issue in this months playboy. im sure you all read about it.
ross| its my joke.|chandler| its my joke.
ross and chandler| its my joke.|ross| yknow, i dont think were going to settle this.
chandler| lets have monica decide.|ross| yeah!
chandler| yeah!|ross| hey mon.
chandler| mon, get out here!|ross| monica! 
chandler| okay, okay. you have to help us decide whose joke this is.|monica| why do i have to decide?
chandler| because youre the only one that can be fair.|ross| yeah.
monica| i cant be fair. youre my boyfriend.|ross| yeah, but im your brother. were family. thats the most important thing in the world.
chandler|  im your only chance to have a baby. okay, lets go.|ross| well each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truthme. 
monica| okay, chandler, you go first.|chandler| okay, i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve.
monica| oh, wait, is he the guy i met at christmas?|chandler| can i finish my story?!
monica| do you want me to pick you?!|ross| see, i would never snap at you like that.
monica| continue.|chandler| so steve said he had to go to the doctor. and steves doctors name is doctor muppy. so i said, doctor monkey? and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up. 
ross| are you kidding? okay, look. i-i studied evolution. remember, evolution? monkey into man? plus, im a doctor, and i had a monkey. im doctor monkey!|chandler| im not arguing with that.
monica| all right, ive heard enough. ive made my decision.|monica| you are both idiots. the joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! you shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! now let it go! the joke sucks! 
ross| its your joke.|chandler| is not.
monica| hi, chandler. there you are.|chandler| hi, oh hi.
monica| hey, its phoebe and rachel. um, why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?|chandler| generosity of spirit.
rachel| wow, you know what? that is the best fake speech i think ive ever heard.|phoebe| really? ive heard better.
monica| wait, wait, he came up with that himself. tell them, chandler.|chandler|  im out of words. should i just say the whole thing again?
monica| look, i am not high maintenance. i am not. chandler!|chandler|  youre a little high maintenance.
monica| ahhh! you are on my list.|chandler| im sorry. youre not easy-going, but youre passionate, and thats good. and when you get upset about the little things, i think that im pretty good about making you feel better about that. and thats good too. so, they can say that youre high maintenance, but its okay, because i like  maintaining you.
monica| . all right youre off my list. |chandler|  
monica|  phoebe, its okay that you dont want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend.|phoebe|  yknow, suddenly i find you very attractive.
chandler| hey, buddy boy, howd the audition go?|joey| not good, no. i didnt get the part, and i lost my job here, so 
phoebe| wow! that is a bad audition.|rachel| how-how did you lose your job here?
joey| well, i had the audition but gunther said i had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. so, i went anyway, and then he fired me.|rachel| he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when youve been working here two days? thats not, thats not right.

ross| yknow what? i think i can take care of myself, ill talk to you later. good-bye.  whoa! uh, that was your sister actually. she-she thinks that youre just using me.|jill| so?

phoebe| no! no! i just went to pick up phoebe buffays checks; there were a lot of them.|joey| nice!
phoebe| um-mmm, and i wont have to go there anymore because i gave them my correct address.|joey| thats great, but isnt it gonna bother that people still think youre a porn star?
phoebe| oh no! no! i know how to handle it.|joey| you do?
phoebe| yeah.  see?|joey| yeah.
chandler| hey.|ross|  you uh, you may have been right about jill.
rachel| oh! i knew it! what happened?|ross| umm, she kissed me.
rachel| what?! you kissed!|chandler|  maybe we should give them some privacy.
monica|  shhhh!!!|ross| look, i uh, i tried not to kiss her, okay?
rachel| well, it doesnt sound like it! i mean, its pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just dont kiss them! see look at us, right now, not kissing!|ross| let me finish, okay? she started kissing me and-and i didnt stop it. i guess i-i just wasnt thinking
rachel| yeah thats right you werent thinking! yknow what? let me give you something to think about! |ross| oh waithold it! but then i started thinking and i stopped the kissing.
rachel| oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sisters mouth long enough to tell me that.|ross| look i-i realize if anything were to happen with me and jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
rachel| what?!|ross| no, i mean, look i dont know if anything is going to happen with us, again. ever. but i dont want to know that it-it never could. so i stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
rachel| wow. i, i dont even know what to say. thank you. |ross| youre welcome. 
monica| oh my god! are-are you crying?|chandler|  i just dont see why those two cant work things out!
jill| all right, im leaving! because im not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. thats you rachel!|rachel| yeah, i got that.
jill|  and you! i throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?|ross| you take care jill.
jill| |rachel| bye-bye-e!
monica| bye.|chandler|  i cant help it, i opened a gate.
rachel| hey, you guys! guess what? barry and mindy are getting a divorce!|monica| oh my god!
phoebe| wow!|joey|  what is the matter with you?!
phoebe| no! barry and mindy.|joey| oh sorry, i hear divorce i immediately go to ross.  who-whos barry and mindy?
rachel| barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend.|joey| ohh-oh, wasnt he cheating on you with her?
rachel| yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.|monica| why did they get divorced?
rachel| well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. isnt that sad?  god, could you imagine if i actually married him?! i mean how different would my life be?|ross| i know what you mean, ive always wondered how different my life would be if-if id never gotten divorced.
phoebe| which time?|ross| the first time! no seriously, imagine if carol hadnt realized she was a lesbian.
joey|  i cant. i keep seeing it the good way.|ross| id bet id still be doing my kara-tay.  towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow, not doing anything else physical.
chandler| maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.|monica| and what if i was still fat?  well, you wouldnt be dating me, thats for sure.
chandler| sure i would!|all|  oh yeah! come on! yeah right!
chandler| what, you guys really think that im that shallow?|ross| no, i just think monica was that fat.
joey| hey, imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives!  oh-hey, theres carol again!|chandler| what if i had had the guts to quit my job? id probably be writing for the new yorker, getting paid to be funny. but my jobs fun too! i mean tomorrow, i-i dont have to wear a tie.
phoebe| what if i had taken that job at merrill lynch?|ross| what?!
rachel| merrill lynch?|phoebe| yeah, i had a massage client who worked there and-and he said i had a knack for stocks.
rachel| well why didnt you take the job?|phoebe| because at that time you see, i thought everything that rhymed was true. so i thought yknow that if id work with stocks, id have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
ross| hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, wed still hang out?|ross|  oh my god! rachel green?
rachel|  rob tillman!|ross| no-no. its-its me, ross!
rachel| oh, im sorry. ross tillman.|ross| no, no-no, ross geller.

monica| including me?|chandler| oh yeah.
chandler| yeah.|ross| yeah, what, what was i thinking?

rachel| wow! i definitely did not see that one backfiring! im gonna go to the bathroom.|ross| yeah, take your time. 
ross|  just-just so you know i was a freshman and she was a senior. so it wasnt as bad as-as|paul| ross, look, i know ive been giving you a lot of jabs and its partly because im very protective of lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. but i have to admit that after all the wonderful things that lizzie has told me and the many, many,  all bad.
ross| not all bad.|paul| and anyhow, im sorry i was so harsh before, but you have to understand that i  still look at lizzie like shes a twelve-year-old girl.
ross| yeah. you know what? i know what you mean; i do that too.|paul| i beg your pardon?
ross| no! no! noti dont mean i-i see her as a twelve-year-old girl! i mean i-i have a son, whos umm six and i still think of him as a baby.|paul| you have a son?
ross| yeah, well my-my ex-wife and i share custody of ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, carol and i are on excellent terms as im sure you are with your wife!  its unbelievable!|paul| dont worry about it, i just didnt realize you were married.  
rachel| oh we were, but that was just a , i mean that was just a big drunken mistake.|ross| youre back.

monica| chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.|chandler| we said seven!
monica| we said six!|chandler| the only way that i said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.

paul| how to make the next one even shorter?|rachel| now wait a minute thats not fair. he was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to emily, he just didnt tell me. 
paul| well, this is fun. so ross, did you kill any of these wives?|ross| yknow what? i-i-i i-i have had enough of this! yknow, i-i-i care a great deal about your daughter and i have treated her with nothing but respect! so if-if youve got a problem with me, frankly

chandler| ross.|ross| oh, come on you guys; thats funny! yknow? because hes needhes got like a hearing aide yknow, cause-cause yknow, cause hes all old, and 
paul| okay look, ross, just so you know that since lizzie likes you so much, ive decided to accept the fact that youre going out with her.|ross| really? that okay, thats great.

phoebe| please, i think you know why.|ross| i cant think of anything.

phoebe| do you think thats something that hed be mad at you for?|ross| i guess it could.
phoebe| well then i think thats it.|ross| well, if hes angry, he really shouldnt just cover it up. i-i wish he would just tell me the truth.
phoebe| oh, if thats what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.|paul| honey i made a reservation at china garden, is that okay?

rachel| thats-thats great! see? i already feel like i know you a little better! thank you. okay, come on. now we can go eat. lets go. |paul| it was horrible. they called me chicken boy.

paul|  so full of dreams|rachel| i dont care about the little dude! i cant! i cannot listen to anymore of this! yknow, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! and then its only because they get paid $100 an hour! do you know how much money i couldve made listening to you? $2,000! and do you know when i figured that out? while you were talking!
paul| what?! i cant believe youre trying to stifle me! when just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!|rachel| oh im sorry. i i-i dont meani didnt mean to stifle you. i this is all just a little overwhelming.
paul| oh rachel, im so sorry. i didnt mean to overwhelm you. its just that, when those gates open, you  hard to close em. but they are closed now. believe me.|rachel| im so glad, im so glad you shared. 
paul| i would really like that. |paul| that wasso good. 
phoebe|  hey.|chandler| i cant believe i let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
phoebe| its not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! its a beautiful ring!|chandler| no, its not! when i looked at the other ring i could see monicas face when i gave it to her, yknow? and i could see her saying yes. when i look at this ring, all i see is a ring! unless i look at it really closely and then i can see my own eye.  look, this is the most important thing im gonna do in my life. i wanna make sure its perfect.
phoebe| okay. there may be a way that we can get the other ring back. cause i heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. so maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.|chandler| i cant do that.
phoebe| well you certainly cant give her that stupid gumball ring.|phoebe| there he is! 
chandler| okay and he hasnt proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.|phoebe| wow! youre good! after this, we should solve crimes.

rachel| phoebe, dont you think youve had enough to drink?|phoebe| im just helping the kids!

mr. thompson|  mr. tribbiani.|joey| oh hi!
mr. thompson| your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.|joey| just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
mr. thompson| i think it was valued at 19,000|joey|  uhh, so bad news. umm, i cant buy the boat, i dont have any money.
rachel| joey! joey, good one! |mr. thompson| thats good. very good! 
joey| so uh listen, i think im gonna take off now. |rachel|  hey! youcantleave joey! you agreed to buy that boat, all right?! that is a contract! and plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!

joey| okay.|rachel| okay.
joey| look, i dont know why the kids need a youth center anyway! yknow? they should just watch tv after school like i did and i turned out fine!|rachel| not great.
monica| and so, were hiding in the bathroom.|richard| and-and then i sneak out and before monica can her parents come in.

monica| i thought you were going out with elizabeth.|ross| yeah, i was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
monica| oh ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just cant get out of!|ross| yknow, maybe she is too young for me. yknow, when i was over there and she was running around with her friends, i felt like i was a baby-sitter. i finally started to see what you guys were talking about. i dont know what to do.
monica| why dont you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. i mean thats what i did when i first  weighing stuff.|ross| okay umm, bad stuff. well, im-im 12 years older than she is.
monica| if the school finds out youre fired.|ross| hmm.
monica| shes leaving for three months.|chandler| for camp!
ross| okay, good stuff. umm, well shes-shes sweet and pretty and|monica| look ross, the only question you need to ask is, \do you see a future?\ i mean like do you see yourself marrying her?  oh my god! you did it already! you married her, didnt you?!
ross| no! no! ididnt do that. its just okay, honestly no. i dont, i dont see a big future with her.|monica| okay well i thinkthats your answer.

phoebe| well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor|joey| glove salesman!
phoebe| good one! yeah.|chandler| this is terrible. what am i going to do?
phoebe| look, she only suspects something okay? she doesnt know for sure, so just throw her off the track.|chandler| thats right, i can throw her off. i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
phoebe| yeah! yeah! convince her that-that youre scared of commitment! convince her that youre a little coward!|chandler| i can do that, ive had 30 years of practice.
joey| hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! |monica|  i had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
joey| that guys still doing that?!|rachel|  oh my god youre here, let me see your hand!!
phoebe| no, youre too late!!! she already took out the trash!!!|ross|  wow! i have never had such a healthy break-up! she was such a grown-up about it! she didnt seem too immature for me! did i just make a huge mistake?

elizabeth| you suck!! |ross| what?!
ross| okay, break-ups still on!|chandler| okay, okay, here she comes!  how do i look? do i look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?
joey| yeah! and also, a little like a french guy.  i never noticed that before.|monica|  hi guys!
joey| hey!|chandler| hey!
monica| what are you up too?|chandler| oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.  yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
joey|  yeah, big brother.|monica| well thats a little crazy. although i am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the internet.
chandler| yeah, well yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?|monica| why?! to celebrate your relationship! to solidify your commitment! to declare your love for one another to the world!
chandler| eh|monica| okay well thats good to know.
joey| |waitress| hey monica, theres a customer who wants to complement the chef, should i let him in?
monica| sure, i love this part! |waitress|  come on in.
richard| hi!|monica| richard!
richard| actually, im not here to complement the chef.|monica| ohh oh, thats okay i hate when people come back to complement the chef. like i have nothing better to do! so whats up?
richard| well, it was great seeing you the other night.|monica| oh, good to see you too. did you come down here to tell me that?
richard| no! i came here to tell you something else.  to tell you i still love you.|monica| what uhwhat did youwhat?!
richard| i still love you. and i know i probably shouldnt even be here telling you this, i mean youre with chandler a guy i really like, and if you say hes straight ill believe you! after seeing ya the other night i knew if i didnt tell ya id regret it for the rest of my life. letting you go was the stupidest thing i ever did.|monica| yknow youre really not supposed to be back here!
richard| well yeah, im sorry. i know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but i had to tell ya! i wanna spend my life with you. i wanna marry you. i wanna have kids with you.|monica| oh god  why dont they put chairs back here?!
richard| i know this is crazy but am i too late?|monica| what the yes youre too late! where was all this three years ago?!
richard| well i know i was an idiot! and i tried to forget you, i really did! yknow after we had lunch last year i spent six months in africa trying to get you out of my head!|monica| what were you doing in africa?
richard| working with blind kids.|monica| ohhh! what are you doing to me?! oh look, i-i im sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
richard| okay thats fine, ill walk away. and ill never bother you again, but only if you tell me chandlers willing to give you everything i am.|monica| well he is! yeah, i mean marriage is all he talks about! my goodness, in fact, im the one thats making him wait!
richard| you are?|monica| yeah!
richard| why?|monica| why? because of the government.
rachel| isnt it incredible?! monica and chandler, gettin married.|phoebe| i know, theyre gonna be so happy together.
rachel| ohh i mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?|phoebe| not that often!
rachel| no! im so happy for them!|phoebe| me too! so happy for them!
rachel| im so happy and not at all jealous.|phoebe| oh no! no god, definitely not jealous!
rachel| i mean im probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. and i mean whats 2%? thats nothing.|phoebe| totally. im like 90/10.
rachel| yeah me too.|joey| hey uh, have you guys scene chandler?
rachel|  whno, but yknow who did stop in here looking for ya, tennille.|monica| so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you dont really believe that do you?
chandler| sure i do. in fact, i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. i mean look at pigs. lets take a second here and look at pigs. okay pigs dont mate for life. i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports!|monica| yeah, but thats pigs not people!
chandler| if marriage worked, id be all for it. but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.|monica| wait a minute. are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
chandler| well, never say never but yknow probably uh yeah, never.|monica| oh my god! then-then-then what are we even doing?! what is this?!
chandler| whoa! whoa! whoa! what is all this pressure?! is this some new kind of strategy? why dont you put down your copy of the rules huh mantrap?!|monica| yknow what?! i gotta go! ugh! 
chandler|  its okay, i got a plan.|rachel| were gonna find love!
phoebe| definitely!|rachel| yeah, im pretty confident about that. thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for monica and chandler! it would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
phoebe| what do you mean?|rachel| well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.
phoebe| you mean a backup?|rachel| exactly!
phoebe| yeah, yeah i got that.|rachel| you do?
phoebe| hm-mmm.|rachel| who?
phoebe| joey.|rachel| joey?!
phoebe| yeah!|rachel| are you serious?!
phoebe| yeah, i locked him years ago!|rachel| wh so if neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry joey.
phoebe| yep, we shook on it. yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.|rachel| oh, seriously?
phoebe| ohh, yeah. i think his exact words were |rachel| charming.
phoebe| well hey, its just a backup.|rachel| yeah.
joey| hey monica!|monica| have you seen rachel? or a mirror?
joey| this is for my boat, pretty cool huh?|monica| yeah, its great.
joey| whoa-whoa, whats the matter?! talk to the captain!|monica| im just having one of those days where you realize youre in a dead-end relationship!
joey| chandler giving you a hard time huh?|monica| its not like i want to get married tomorrow! its just that i-id like to believe that im in a relationship thats actually going somewhere, that im not just wasting my time!
joey| well, you know chandler.|monica| no i dont know chandler! not anymore! its like its like somethings changed.
joey| maybe you changed?|monica| i didnt change!
joey| maybe thats the problem.|monica| what?!
joey| chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.|monica| is that some kind of boat talk?
joey| i dont know!  i havent totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.|monica| what does he think? does he think im just gonna wait around for nothing?
joey| monica face it, chandler is against marriage. and-and always will be!|monica|  well theres some people who do want to marry me.
joey| there are?|monica| yeah! richard!
joey| r-r-richard said he wants to marry you?!  and-and chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?!|monica| thats right.
joey| chandler loves marriage!!|monica| you just told me that he hates marriage! that-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife! that-that hes against marriage and always will be!
joey| you got that from what i said?!|narrator| when the cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
ross| what happened you guys?|ross| rach!
rachel| hey you!|ross| hey, come on in.
rachel| oh thank you. hey yknow, im so sorry to hear about you and elizabeth.|ross| oh, thanks. yeah, i really thought wed be able to make it work, but uh, i guess it just wasnt meant to be.
rachel| yeah, love. its a tricky business isnt it?|ross| i guess so.
rachel| so what do you say we make a pact? if you and i are both single by the time were 40, we get married. i mean, we know each other, we like each other, and weve-weve already slept together so yknow therell be no surprises there! you know what i mean? no like, \whats that?!\|ross| right. ohh! you-you want me to be your backup.
rachel| exactly.|ross| ohh, yeah i already have one.
rachel| what? who?|ross| phoebe.
rachel| phoebe?! wait abut-but she just, she said that joey was her backup.|ross| ohh, i dont think so.
rachel| ross! i just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and joey made a deal!|ross| thats impossible! i mean we have had a deal for years! we-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
joey| where the hell have you been?!|chandler| i was making a coconut phone with the professor.
joey| richard told monica he wants to marry her!|chandler| what?!
joey| yeah! yeah, ive been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe i would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldnt keep flying off!|chandler| myoh my god!
joey| i know! they suck!!|chandler| hes not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! im supposed to do that!
joey| i know!|chandler| well what yknow what im gonna do? im gonna go over there; im gonna kick his ass!  will you help me?!
joey| look, chandler i dont think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. okay? just go and find monica!|chandler| youre right.
joey| yeah!|chandler| okay.  im just going to propose!
joey| okay.|chandler| okay great.
joey| dude-dude-dude!|chandler| what?!
joey| let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.|monica| hi.
richard| hi.|monica| i dont know why im here.
richard| i didnt ask. you wanna come in?|monica| i dont know.
richard| oh, okay. well, ill just leave the door open and go sit on the couch. |monica|  chandler is such an idiot!
richard|  drink?|monica| yeah, ill have a scotch
richard| on the rocks with a twist? i remember. |monica|  still smoking cigars?
richard| uh, no! no! thatsart! if it bothers you i can put my art out.|monica| no thats, thats okay.
richard| so monica let me ask you a question. yknow, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?|monica| uh yeah, i-i actually i thought about you a couple months ago.
richard| oh really?|monica| yeah but it was because i-i had an eye exam and i dont like my new eye doctor.
richard| who is it?|monica| edward nevski?
richard| yeah hes no good. do you ever  non-eye doctor way?|monica| no.
richard| ahh.|monica| but getting over was the hardest thing that ive ever had to do. and i never let myself think about you.
rachel| phoebe! you picked joey and ross?! you can not have two backups!|phoebe| of course i can! its just good sense to backup your backup! look, ive already lost chandler!
rachel| what?!|joey|  hey!

joey| what? |chandler| what?!
joey| you guys kissed! oh mythis is huge!|rachel| no!

phoebe| why?!|rachel| honey, monica, this is ridiculous! look
monica| no-no, i-i really dont want to talk about it! i dont! |joey| psss, that is whack!
phoebe|  okay, i think ill play it at the wedding.|joey| yeah! well, i think well see if they actually let you play. huh? i mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, \you look 19,\ and then they just take it away like-like, \no you dont.\
phoebe| well, i dont think monica is gonna take this away.|joey| wouldnt she?
phoebe| would she?|joey| would she?  you ate my candy bar!
ross| guess who? |rachel| hey.
ross| hey, i just realized we kinda left some stuff up in the air|rachel| what do you think monica meant when she said she didnt want to talk, especially with me? i mean, why not especially you and me? we were both out there kissing.
ross| still thinking about it huh?|rachel| come on! serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?  especially you!
ross|  oh, who cares?|rachel| i care!
ross|  and so do i.|rachel| yknow what, i-i have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
ross| okay. sure. |rachel| am i going to let you watch me undress?

chandler| its paris, who knows were here!|monica| 
phoebe| okay, you said i could sing at your wedding so, im just gonna need a small deposit.|monica| what?!
phoebe| yknow, just some good faith money to hold the date.|chandler| pheebs, were not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
phoebe| oh, i see. |joey| they break your heart, dont they?
phoebe| yknow, i dont really need their permission.|joey| yeah! if you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
phoebe| yeah! and if you wanna look 19, then you you gotta do something about your eyes.|joey| what?! whats wrong with my eyes.
phoebe| they give you away! theres just-theres just too much wisdom in there.  just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.|joey| and thatll get rid of my wisdom?
phoebe| maybe just 10 minutes for you.|chandler| oh, give her the deposit! give her the ring! i dont care!
monica| yes.|rachel| monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnt want to talk to anyone, especially me?
chandler| what a great apology!  and you accept! okay, bye-bye!|rachel| no-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
monica| well, lets just say its not the first time youve stolen my thunder.|rachel| what?!

monica| my sweet sixteen! remember, you went to third base with my cousin charlie.|chandler|  ahh, third base.
monica| its all everybody at the party could talk about!|rachel| monica, yknow what? the only reason i did that was because your party was so boring!
monica|  we had a caricaturist!|rachel| oh!! 
phoebe|  |rachel| monica, your sweet sixteen was like a million years ago.
monica| and yet, here we are doing it again.|rachel| ugh, monica i dont want to steal your stupid thunder!
monica| oh please! why else would you have made out with ross?!|ross| got me. 
rachel| all right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it aint gonna happen!|monica| i just thought it would be nice if i could have just this one night!
rachel| i swear, i never wanted any part of your night!|monica| oh, is that why you did it in the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
ross| uh, rachel, ive been thinking. i dont think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. im calling it off.|chandler|  why to save your dignity my man.
rachel|  monica, why? why would i ever want to take away from your night?|monica| i dont know! i dontmaybe youre feeling a little resentful. maybe ah, maybe you thought youd get married first! maybe you cant stand the fact that your formerly fat friend is getting married before you!
rachel| oh wow. thatyknow what? that is so unfair. yknow what? now i want to steal your thunder! come on ross, lets go have sex!|monica|  i cant believe youre gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
chandler| well, somebody should. |ross| look uh, if were gonna do this
rachel| were not gonna do this, all right? shes just gonna think that were doin it.|ross| oh, i see, so everybody wins.

rachel| yeah, you like that baby?  may we help you?|monica| i just wanted to say that i hope you do have sex tonight and i hope that you guys get back together, but i must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement im going to announce that im pregnant!
chandler| how is that ever going to happen?!|rachel| all right monica, do you want to know why i was with ross tonight?!
monica| i know why!|rachel| no you dont know why!
monica| okay! why?!|rachel| because! because i was sad.
monica| what do you mean?|rachel| look, i am soso happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that im not. im not even close. and i dont know, maybe i just wanted to make myself feel better. and i know that thats dumb, but oh my god you were so depressed when ross got married that you slept with chandler!
chandler|  i dont care, she slept with me.|rachel| anyway sweetie, i am, im so sorry i ruined your night.
monica| |ross|  congratulations man.

rachel| yeah, so lets get started on the wedding plans!|monica| okay! 
chandler|  already?!|rachel| yeah, we got a lot to do! we gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music
chandler| oh, i got some thoughts on that.|rachel| oh wait chandler, too many cooks
ross| take it from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.|monica| 
chandler| what in gods name is that?!|ross| oh my god, the wedding book?! i havent seen that since the forth grade!
monica| this baby has got everything. take yknow, locations for instance.  first, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage. |phoebe| that is so smart!  break it off. break it off now.
ross| and that should conclusively prove that i had the idea for jurassic park first! now lets take a look at |phoebe| hey! ross!
ross| phoebe, oh my god! wh-wh-what are you doing here?|phoebe| i need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. its about monica and chandler.
ross| oh my god! of course, of course.  wh-whats going on?|phoebe| well, umm, not much. but, i was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow? so, could i just move in with you for a couple days?
ross| umm, okay, yeah, sure. but wh-whats wrong with monica and chandler?|phoebe| nothingwhy?!
ross| phoebe, you said it was urgent!|phoebe| oh yeah it is! im going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
ross| do you realize i have a classroom full of students?|phoebe|  oh, im sorry. im so rude. does anyone want to come to the movies?
monica| all right, so i havent cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.|rachel| okay.
monica| all right umm, a string quartet for the procession.|rachel| aw.
monica| a jazz trio for cocktails. the bay city rollers for dancing. wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.|chandler| well, you couldnt get them anyway. ian doesnt play anymore and derrick  and derrick is a name i shouldnt know.
joey|  yknow, something a little snugglyer?|chandler| why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
joey| well, the duck|rachel| what?! the duck?! what the hell did the damn duck do now?!
joey| uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!|chandler| now, do i get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
monica| of course you can look at it! yeah, i want your opinion too!|chandler| okay.
monica| here you go! what do you think about centerpieces?|chandler| centerpieces!
monica| yeah! roses or lilies? |chandler| definitely roses.  but lilies are the clear choice.
monica| oh my god! its like one mind.|chandler| uh-huh!
joey|  guys! guys!! you gotta let me nap! ugh, im gonna get cranky!|rachel| joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
joey| yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!|rachel| what?!
joey| all right, im gonna go! |rachel| now joey, what did the duck do?!
joey| i dont know! but he did not eat your face cream!|joey| hey little buddy, how are you feeling? 
ross| uh, phoebe|phoebe| oh ross, hi.
ross| phoebe, what are you doing?|phoebe| im sorry, im with a client right now.
ross| phoebe!|phoebe| okay, lets talk outside.
ross| phoebe, you cant massage people in my apartment!|phoebe| whats the big deal? i did it at monica and chandlers!
ross| and they knew about it?|phoebe|  okay, well ross, what is this really about?
ross| look, this is my home and i want to be able to come and go whenever i want!|phoebe| okay, i will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. i just dont know what the big deal is!
ross| the big deal is i dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when i want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! cold beer.|rachel| hey joey, what cha doing?
joey| sweepin. why? turn you on?|rachel| no.
joey| huh. what if i was sweeping a chimney?|rachel| joey, did you  eat my face cream?
joey| where are you going? the vicar wont be home for hours.|rachel| joey,  where did you learn that word?
joey| where do you think,  zelda?|rachel|  you found my book?!
joey| yeah i did!|rachel| joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
joey| okay, look im sorry, i went in there to take a nap and i know i shouldnt have, but you got porn!|rachel| hey-hey, yknow what? i dont care! im not ashamed of my book. theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a littleerotica. its just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. 
joey| you got porn!|ross| hello.
woman| hi, is uh phoebe here?|ross| uh no-no, she-shes out for the night.
woman| ohh great.|ross| can i, can i help you with something?
woman| well, i dont know. are you a masseur?|ross|  yes i am.
woman| great!  |mrs. geller| so chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
chandler| oh yeah, i should probably call them.|mr. geller| i remember when we first got engaged.
chandler| oh, i dont think i ever heard that story.|monica| oh dad, really you dont need to
mr. geller|  well, id gotten judy pregnant. i still dont know how that happened.|mrs. geller|  you dont know how that happened?! your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
chandler| what a sweet story.|monica| well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade halloween party.
mr. geller| what?! they wanted a scary story!|monica| anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well i guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the monica wedding fund.  what?
mrs. geller| you tell her jack, i cant do it.|monica| what happened? you still have the monica wedding fund dont you?
mr. geller| we have it. only now, we call it the beach house.|monica| i dont believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
mrs. geller| were sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 youd pay for it yourself.|monica| you bought the beach house when i was 23!
mr. geller| which means you had seven years of beach fun and you cant put a price on that sweetie.|mrs. geller| we really do feel bad about this though.
mr. geller| we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.|monica| what about when i started dating chandler?
mrs. geller| well it was chandler! we didnt think hed ever propose!|chandler| clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. 
monica| i cant believe it! that there is no money for my wedding?!|mrs. geller| we might still have some money, if your father didnt think it was a good idea to sell ice over the internet.
mr. geller| it seemed like such a simple idea.|mrs. geller| stupid jack, the word is stupid.
mr. geller| all right, enough! i dont want to hear about it anymore! |ross| okay! now, im going to touch you. 
monica| i cant believe this. do you think that your parents could help pay for it?|chandler| i dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. shes saving the rest for her divorce. and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  dollywood.
rachel| well what happened at dinner?|monica| my parents spent the money for our wedding!
phoebe|  my god! what did you order?!|rachel| wait, but theres no money! well this is terrible! you guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
chandler| honey, its gonna be okay.|monica| no! no its not! its not gonna be okay! it sucks! no swing band! no lilies!
rachel| no, yknow what? its gonna be okay. i mean you dont have to have this rustic italian feast. yknow? and-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. |chandler| look, it really is gonna be okay. the important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married.
rachel| do you even understand what off the rack means?!|phoebe| look, why dont you just pay for it yourself?
monica| how? i dont have any money.|chandler| well, i have some.
monica| how much?|chandler| well, close to  
monica| whoa!!! are you kidding me?!|rachel| well what?! how-how much is it?!
monica| its enough for wedding scenario eight.|rachel| ohh!  really?!
monica|  how great are you, you little saver?! i mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!|rachel|  ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
chandler| well, youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?|rachel and monica| ah, yeah!
chandler| well, come on, ive been saving this money for six years and i kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.|phoebe|  hello, mr. chandler.
monica| this is the most special day of our lives.|chandler| no, i realize that honey, but im not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
monica| honey, umm i-i love you,  listen, we could always earn more money, okay? but uh, were only gonna get married once.|chandler| look, i understand, but i have to put my foot down. okay? the answer is no.
monica| you-youre gonna have to put your foot down?|chandler| yes, i am!
phoebe| wow, money and a firm hand. finally a chandler i can get on board with.|joey| hey rach.
rachel|  joey.|joey| hey rach, do you smell smoke?
rachel| uh-huh, i get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.|joey| no-no-no, im serious. you dont smell it? somethings on fire.
rachel| well no, i dont smell anything.|joey| oh, yknow what? its probably just your burnin loins.
ross|  hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?|rachel| nothing!
ross| |rachel| yknow, i can not believe you told him, joey!
ross| so i guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?|rachel| uh-huh, yeah i did, because i wore out my first copy when i was with you. 
ross|  sup?|phoebe|  ross! how could you do that to an old man?!
ross|  im sorry?|phoebe| my massage client, arthur? his daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
ross|  i gave him an extremely professional massage!|phoebe| he said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
ross| okay, so it wasnt uh, a traditional massage. but i did give him acu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. and, and i gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.|phoebe| well, hes never coming back! okay? you just cost me eight dollars a week!
ross| hey, yknow what? this is your fault! youre the one that didnt move his-his appointment.|phoebe| oh, its my fault?! you didnt have to massage him! you couldve sent him away! you couldve not rolled tonka trucks up and down his back!
ross| he said he liked that!! oh youre right, youre right. im sorry.|joey| dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
ross| his daughter was hot.|joey| gotcha.
monica| hey.|chandler| hey.
monica| listen umm, ive been thinking, its not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that.|chandler| ehh.
monica| eh, you work for that.|chandler| look, i thought about it too, and im sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
monica| you do?!|chandler| yeah, im putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thats what were gonna do.
monica| oh, youre so sweet.  oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?|chandler| eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, yknow? well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
monica| you thought about that?|chandler| yeah.
monica| how many kids were we gonna have?|chandler| uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
monica| what else did you think about?|chandler| well, stuff like whered we live, yknow? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. yknow, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, wed have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old.
monica|  yknow what? i-i dont want a big, fancy wedding.|chandler| sure you do.
monica| no, i want everything you just said. i want a marriage.|chandler| you sure?
monica| uh-hmm.|chandler| i love you so much.
monica| i love you.  hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.|chandler| oh yeah, totally!
monica| oh good.|joey| hello, zelda.

chandler| hey! hows the boat?!|joey| great! im finally getting into this sailing stuff.
monica| oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?|joey| why would i do that? it took three guys to get the thing in there!
phoebe| if you dont sail your boat, what do you do on it?|joey| oh, its great! its a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. 
chandler| well, its good that you finally have a place to do that.|rachel| yknow joey, i could teach you to sail if you want.
joey| you could?|rachel| yeah! ive been sailing my whole life. when i was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
phoebe| your own boat?|rachel| what?! what?! he was trying to cheer me up! my pony was sick.
chandler| do you know what i was thinkin?|monica| what?
chandler| nothing, i just like to go like this. |ross|  hey chandler, what are you doing tonight?
chandler| uh why, do you have a lecture?|ross| no, why?
chandler| then free as a bird. whats up?|ross| my dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
monica| wow! thats great! dad must really like you, he doesnt ask just anyone to play.|ross| yeah and he didnt really ask for you, he asked for chancy, i assumed he meant you.
chandler| well, did-did you correct him?|ross| no, i-i thought it would be more fun this way.
monica| this is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.|ross| or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. he does that every week too.
monica| oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.|ross| yeah.
monica| he hates to lose.|chandler| oh no problem, maybe ill play with my left hand.
ross| youre not a lefty? |chandler| does anybody know me?!
monica| whats wrong phoebe?|phoebe| i just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
monica| no!! why didnt you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!|phoebe|  because im normal! that was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and i know you wanted it as an engagement present.
ross| oh, we have to get you an engagement present?|chandler| dont worry about it pheebs.
ross| no one got me an engagement present.|phoebe| okay, here i wish you health and happiness.  
chandler| an old cookie?|monica|  this is what happens when you dont register for gifts!
phoebe| see no-no, i made a batch and i froze it, and this is the only one left.|chandler| we cant accept this.
phoebe| why not?|chandler| cause its gross.
monica| no! wait! i think i can figure out the recipe from this cookie! i do stuff like this at work all the time.|phoebe| really?!
monica| yeah! i bet i can do it.|chandler| okay, we owe you a present.
ross| two! ive been engaged twice!|joey|  who names his boat coast guard anyway?
rachel| that is the coast guard. |joey| what are they doing out here? the coasts all the way over there. 
rachel| joey, just ignore the boats all right? were not finished with the lesson yet.|joey| all right.
rachel| okay, im just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?|joey| come on rach, not again. i got it! okay? lets start sailing, and i want to go over there  yo-ho-ho!
rachel| oh, okay. is that what you want to do? you wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? okay, lets do that sailor joe. quick question though,  whats this called?|joey| uh, boat rope.
rachel| wrong! how do you get the mainsail up?|joey|  uh, rub it?
rachel| no. what do you do if i say we are coming about?|joey| id say, come again. no-no, wait i-i-i know this one, i know this one, uh
rachel| times up, now you're dead.|joey| and deaf!
rachel| okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. am i getting through to you sailor?! |joey| yes.
rachel| dont just say yes! this isnt a game, joey, you can really get hurt out here. okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!|joey| i want to make a ship to shore call to chandler.
monica| all right, i definitely taste nutmeg.|phoebe| you do?
monica| you dont?  well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.|phoebe| that and arrogance.
joey|  hey.|monica| hey! how was sailing?
joey| i dont want to talk about it. yknow, you couldve at least saved me a whole cookie. |monica and phoebe| no-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
joey| |phoebe| i cant believe that! now the only thing left of my grandmothers legacy is this crumb.  i wish you a long and happy marriage.
ross|  hey.|monica| hey! how was it?
ross| well i had a great time! umm, chancy on the other hand|chandler| i will tell the story! it was going great. i let him win. we were bonding. he even said i could call him dad.
ross| and what did he ask you not to call him?|chandler| daddy. all right look, heres the story.  so i take off my glasses and thats when it happened.
chandler| guys?|ross| over here. 
mr. geller| have a seat son. |monica| oh my god chandler! i cant believe it!
chandler| i know.|monica| you gave my father a lap dance!
chandler| why do they put so much steam in there?!|ross| cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room.
chandler| why? okay? why? wh-wh-why did that have to happen?|phoebe| come on, its not that big a deal!
chandler| not that big a deal? therethere was touching of things.|ross| now, i know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
monica| listen, im sure that dad doesnt care. he probably thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years!|chandler| i dont want him to tell this story for years.
ross| oh, but he will. he still tells the story how monica tried to escape from fat camp.|monica| i wasnt escaping.
ross| then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?|monica| i was trying to help out a squirrel.
ross| you were trying to eat it!|chandler| if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
monica| |chandler|  all right, im off to see your dad.
ross| whoa-whoa, arent you a little over dressed?|rachel|  yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
chandler| look, i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and i figure the best way to do that is face to faceand by face i dont mean his lap. and by face, i dont mean my ass. |ross|  hey are you getting monica and chandler an engagement present?
rachel| i dont know. yknow, they didnt get us anything.|ross| thank you!
joey|  hey.|ross| hey.
rachel| well hello! so, when are we gettin back out on the water matey? |joey| oh uh, i dont know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
rachel| why not?|joey| because! youre mean on the boat!
rachel| what? i was just trying to teach you.|joey| well, lesson learned! rachel is mean!
ross| yeeeeeep yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. i remember when she took me out on her dads boat she wouldnt let me help at all.|rachel| excuse me, i wanted you to help, but you couldnt move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
ross| you have to respect the sea! |rachel| look joey, im sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but i gotta tell ya something. that was not mean. okay, my father is mean. he used to yell at me all the time on the boat, i mean it was horrible. i was just being a good teacher.
joey| does a good teacher say, \put down the beer pinhead!?\|rachel| well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
joey| six and a half! you knocked that last one out of my hand! remember?|rachel| yeah, i didnt want you to get hit by the boom!
joey| well it hit me anyway! and it wouldve hurt a lot less if i had finished that last beer.|rachel| all right, yknow what? i-im sorry. i will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
joey| you wont boss me around anymore?|rachel| i wont boss you around.
joey| and youll be nice?|rachel| and, ill be nice.
joey| and youll be topless?|rachel| andjoey!
joey| do you want me to learn?!|monica| okay, heres batch 22. oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers. this has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
ross| lets give it a shot.|monica| okay. man, i have not made this many cookies since i was in the ninth grade.
phoebe| oh, what was that for? like a bake sale?|monica| no, just a friday night.
ross|  oh, these are pretty good.|phoebe| yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
ross| which one was that?|monica| the ones we had right after you almost threw up.
ross| oh yeah! batch 17 was good. i did not like batch 16.  im okay.|phoebe| are there any more from the good batch? cause we could just work off of those.
ross| yeah, ooh yeah, i think there is one from batch 17 left, uh |rachel| okay joey honey, youre doing really good! all right, now im just gonna need you to step to the port side.  remember? remember how we talked about the port side?
joey|  oh yeah.|rachel| right?
joey| nope.|rachel| its left sweetie, but thats okay sweetie, thats a tough one.
joey| i dont know why you just dont say left.|rachel| okay, go to the left.  the left!
joey| huh?|rachel| 
joey|  okay! okay, youre yelling again! see that?|rachel| no! no-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
joey| oh, yknow what? since im here, i think im gonna have me a little beer on the port side. |rachel| okay joey, were luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? 
joey| uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff i didnt know there.|rachel| joey, come on! we just went over this! 
joey| oh, yknow, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. did you see it? it was gross!|rachel|  no! all right?! i did not see the bird! i did not see the fish! i did not see the piece of styrofoam that was shaped like mike tyson! i did not, because i was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
joey| all right thats it! youre yelling and i dont see you taking your top off! i quit!|rachel| what do you mean you quit?! you cant quit!
joey| why not?!|rachel| because youre not finished yet and i wont have it! greens do not quit!
joey| greens? im a tribbiani! and tribbianis quit!|rachel| oh my god, wait did ii just said greens dont quit didnt i?  did i just say greens dont quit?!
joey| yes! yes! you did and youre still yelling at me!|rachel| no! no! no! im not yelling at you, im just yelling near you. oh god joey, oh im my father. oh my god, this is horrible! ive been trying so hard not to be my mother i did not see this comin. oh, joey, im sorry. im so sorry. i just wanted you to learn.
joey| well, hey i did learn.|rachel| really?
joey| yeah! come on.|rachel| awww
joey| yeah, its okay. i know what a mainsail is.  i know, i know to duck when the boom comes across. i-i know port is right.|rachel| left.
joey| damnit!|phoebe| yknow, i bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that were trying to figure out her recipe. i bet shes l-l-lookin up at us and smiling right now.
ross| looking up?|phoebe| oh yeahno, she was really nice to me, but shes in hell for sure.
monica| well, ive tried everything. i give up. i guess im not gonna be the mom who makes the worlds best chocolate cookies. i do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. kids love that right.|ross| aww, pheeb, come on isnt there any relative that would have the recipe? what about, what about your sister?
phoebe| oh no-no, no, i made a promise to myself that the next time i would talk to ursula would be over my dead body. and thats not happening til october 15th, 2032.|ross| thats the day youre gonna die? seedarnit, ive got shuffleboard that day.
phoebe| thats what you think.|monica| well, i mean what about friends of your grandmothers? wouldnt they have the recipe?
phoebe| well, yknow i may have relatives in france who would know. my grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, nesele tolouse.|monica| what was her name?
phoebe| nesele toulouse.|monica| nestle tollhouse?!
phoebe| oh, you americans always butcher the french language.|monica| 
phoebe|  oh.|monica| i cannot believe that i just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
phoebe| i know! you see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!!|chandler| so you understand, id feel a lot more comfortable if you didnt tell people what happened. yknow, im a littleim a little embarrassed about it.
mr. geller| i understand completely, theres nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. as a matter of fact, when i started dating judy i was unemployed, and her father asked me what i did for a living and i told him i was a lawyer.|chandler| what did you do when they found out?
mr. geller| they never did, so if you ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. shall we? |chandler| so i guess we wear swimsuits in here!
rachel| well joey, i hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.|joey| yeah, yeah. hey, why dont you give a pull on that rope? 
rachel|  oh were not sailing.|joey| just pull on it.
rachel| all right.  sandwiches!|joey| what else?
rachel|  here you go.|joey| thank you.
rachel| oh wow! |joey| what are you doing?
rachel|  oh, sorry.|joey| what youdont hold it like that! youre lettin all the good stuff fall out.
rachel|  oh whoops.|joey| careful! youre wasting good pastrami!  oh my god! im my dad!
mac| |c.h.e.e.s.e| you can say that again mac.
mac| well, i couldnt have done it without you buddy. youre a genius.|c.h.e.e.s.e| oh yeah? well then how come i cant get my vcr to stop blinking 12:00?
joey|  so, what did you guys think?|monica| 
chandler| its your mommy. its your mommy.|ross| ohhhh
rachel| thats nice.|joey| 
rachel| well that was ummokay.|ross| it wasnt the best.

chandler| because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!|monica| no! but because he thought i was too faaaaa.  and every time i think about it, it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade! yknow, i-i really think that you should apologize to julie.
chandler| what? are you kidding? that was like 16 years ago.|monica| no, i know. but yknow what? it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me.
chandler| okay, i will do it. but i have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you fell in love with!|joey| okay, all right, this is how its going to work. were gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
ross| no, 10 is the highest.|joey| why is 10 the highest?
ross| because its the highest. |joey|  i dont want to marry chandler!
rachel| okay, uh|joey| ive got cold feet.
rachel| its gonna be okay!|joey| no, one man for the rest of my life? i dont know if i can do it! this means ill never get to sleep with joey!
rachel| look monica, getting cold feet is very common. yknow, its-its just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love chandler. and also, i ran out on a wedding. you dont get to keep the gifts.|joey|  very good! drawing on your own experience, i like that!

rachel| thank you. thank you very much. umm, ive known them separately and ive known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. so i would like to raise my glass  to monica and chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. i can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.|joey| wow.  good speech.
ross| yeah, it really was!|rachel| aw, thanks!
ross| okay phoebe, i guess youre next  although i really dont see the point.|joey| yeah.
phoebe| okay, i cant believe that monica and chandler are getting married. i remember talking about this today with rachel while we were showering together, naked. |joey| and shes back in the game.
chandler|  julie hi! chandler bing, i, i guess you remember me.|julie| hello skidmark.
chandler|  its a nickname, ill explain later.|monica| its pretty clear.
chandler| ah, uh, i owe you a long overdue apology. i never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.|julie| thats why you broke up with me?
chandler| you-you-you didnt know that.  well, i guess my work here is done!|joey| all right, well first of all i would like to say that you both performed very well. okay? you should be proud of yourselves. and-and i would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. well, except for racheldamnit!

ross| im sorry rach, it was, it was really close.|rachel| well then i demand a recount! 
ross| actually, it wasnt that close.|rachel| no! yknow what? no! no! you thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculouswere gonna flip a coin! 
phoebe| the coins have finally forgiven me!|rachel| well yknow what? i hope monica forgives you after you throw her her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! 
phoebe|  you guys are the best!|joey| boy i tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
ross| yeah?|joey| yeah! i was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.  
ross| why-why would i care about that?|joey| no reason, im just saying that uh thats where ill be. 
chandler| as bad as that went, i actually enjoyed myself. i think that im going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do.|monica| why dont you just stop doing stupid things? then you wouldnt have to apologize.
chandler| i would really love it if i could do both.|monica| all right, ii have to ask.
chandler| what?|monica| are you gonna break up with me if i get fat again?
chandler| what?!|monica| well, you broke up with julie grath! how much weight could she have gained?
chandler| a hundred and forty-five pounds.|monica| in one year?! my god what did she eat? her-her family! thats not the point.
chandler| look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but i was 15!|monica| well thats not the only time this was an issue. you remember when umm, you spent thanksgiving with us? you called me fat.
chandler| okay. okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.|monica| how?
chandler| you were not supposed to hear that! i said that behind you back!|monica| what if i have babies, okay? i mean im gonna look different. im okay with that, but im not sure that you are!
chandler| look you have to realize i dont think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  see this is one of things that i can apologize for later! look, what i mean is youre monica! okay? and i am in love with monica. |monica| keep going.
chandler| so you can balloon up or you can shrink down and i will still love you.|monica| even if i shrink down to two inches tall?

joey| no-no-no-no-no! its a surprise, but its gonna be tricky though because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.|phoebe and rachel| oh no, yeah.
rachel| jo-joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? umm, i kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, shes not lookin for a serious relationship.|joey| where are you gettin this?

chandler| i say we go with careless whisper.|janice| chandler?
chandler|  did she see us yet? did she see us?|monica| janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
janice| well umm, i thought i was going to go back to my apartment but then i just felt i couldnt really be alone tonight.  i was wondering if i could maybe stay here with you, just i really feel that i need to be with family.|monica|  our kids are gonna call her aunt janice arent they?
janice| please, its because otherwise i really dont know what i might do.|chandler| arent you just a tinsy bit curious?
janice|  do you have any tissues?|monica| yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
janice| okay! |monica| well justwell just let her stay.
chandler| no-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!|monica| kinda like your barcalounger.
chandler| is that what youre thinking about right now?|monica| i never stop thinking about it.
janice| hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before i take my bath.|chandler| janice, im sorry but umm, you cant stay here tonight.
janice| why not?|chandler| honestly? our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. now monica and i have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
janice| okay, im going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise i get very nasal. |monica| oh my god! oh my god! you have to go!
janice| why?|monica| because chandler still has feelings for you!
janice| he does?|chandler| say again?
monica| thats right. thats right. and that is why you cant stay here tonight. and probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding.|chandler| feelings, such strong feelings.
monica| i mean, i realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.|janice| ohmy gawd, i-i understand. i-i am so sorry, ill go. 
ross| okay, see you later. |chandler| i just wanted to show monica your book. 
ross|  hey everybody! happy thanksgiving! |chandler| no, no, no. no-no-no. 
ross| what, are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year? |chandler| no, we're playing this game i learned at work. you have to name all the states in six minutes. 
ross| what? that's like insanely easy! |chandler| now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. you always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen . 
monica| it's a stupid game and i wasn't playing against other people, so technically i didn't lose. |ross| what? you forgot fourteen states? 
monica| nobody cares about the dakotas. |chandler| oh, okay, time's up! 
rachel| all right, i got 48. |chandler| oh that's not bad, pheebs? 
phoebe| oh, i got tired of naming states. so i decided to list the types of celery, and i have one: regular celery. |chandler| okay, so rachel's got 48 and phoebe has the lead invegetables, joey? 
joey| say hello to the new champ of chandler's dumb states game. |ross| wow, how many have you got? 
joey| fifty-six! |joey| hey! how is new england not a state? huh? they have a sports team! 
chandler| does south oregon have a sports-team?  there you go. |rachel|  how come we have one extra place setting? 
monica| 'cause you invited your assistant. |rachel| oh, right. sorry. but tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending thanksgiving with her. 
monica| oh! why didn't you tell me? i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin. |rachel| well, i was going to, but then i figured, you know... your food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. 
monica| now you think i wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake,  but i still do.|phoebe| regular celery!  
ross| done! with time-a to spare. |chandler| oooh that may be a new world's record  
ross| you know, i hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and joey can't name all the states. did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called \a globe?\ hmm? |chandler| uh, magellan? you got 46 states.  
ross| what? that's impossible. |joey| 46. wow! who's well educated now, mr. i-forgot-ten-states? 
monica| all right, i'm out of oven space. i'm gonna turn on joey's. please, watch him! do not let joey eat any of the food! |chandler| i am only one man!  okay ross, time is up! 
ross| no, just give me another minute. |chandler| look ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? that is the beauty of this game. it makes you want to kill yourself. 
ross| this-this is crazy! i can do this! all right, uhh, i bet i can get all 50 before dinner. |chandler| okay, but if you can'tno dinner! 
ross| you're on! |joey|  all right. don't look at my list, ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have. 
monica|  hey, did you guys know that your oven doesn't work? |joey| but the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? 
monica| ross, i'm gonna use yours, okay? |ross| pshhshhh!
monica| chandler? can you give me a hand?  |chandler| sure, and joey; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment. 
joey| don't worry, chandler, it's not a globe of the united states. |phoebe| hey you guys i'm gonna go out and take a walk. 
ross| phoebe, why is your bag moving? |phoebe| oh, it's not! 
rachel| seriously, it's moving! |joey| what the hell is in there? 
phoebe| it's just my knitting that's all!  yes! i knit this. i'm very good. |monica| rosss apartment is nice! how come we don't hang out here more often? 
chandler| i don't know. maybe it's because it smells a little weird. it's like old pumpkins or something. |monica| that's my pie! 
chandler| which smells delicious! |monica| uh-oh! uh-oh! 
chandler| what? |monica| we left joey alone with the food!  yep! yep, i knew it! there he is... feeding stuffing to a dog! 
phoebe|  hi geller-bing residence. how can i help?|monica| phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment? 
phoebe| i'm sorry, who's this? |monica| phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! 
chandler| tell her, i'm allergic, and i will sue! |phoebe| no, there's no dog here? 
monica| yes there is! he's black and white and shaggy and  he's sitting next to rachel and licking rachel's hand. |phoebe| oh my god! where are you? 
monica| i'll be right there! |phoebe|  they're here already? how are they doing this? 
rachel|  hi tag! what are you doing here? |tag| i, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend thanksgiving with you is still good. 
rachel| well, sure! come in!  well, what-what happened to your girlfriend? |tag| we kinda broke up this morning. 
rachel| oh, i'm sorry. |tag| yeah, so she went back to ohio.
ross| ohio!! thank you! |chandler| huh! where is the dog?!
ross| what dog? there-there's no dog here. |joey| yeah that dog left! 
monica|  phoebe! phoebe, open up! |phoebe| there's no dog in here. 
chandler| phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! |phoebe| no that's just me coughing!  oh, good, there you are! listen, um, i have a dog in my room. 
chandler| what is it doing here? |phoebe| well, i'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. wait.  hello, my name is clunkers. may i please stay with you nice people?
monica| oooh, i wish she could stay here, but chandler is allergic! |chandler| extremely allergic, okay? if i'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up! 
phoebe| that's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days |chandler|  really? 
monica| chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? |chandler| well, it still has to go, right?
monica and phoebe| why? |chandler| okay, it's um
joey|  don't do it! |monica| don't do what? 
chandler|  okay, i hate dogs. |all| what? 
phoebe| are you crazy? |ross| are you out of your mind?
phoebe| why? |joey| told ya. 
chandler| they are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit. |ross| right, they are scary.  ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
rachel| wait a minute. do you not like all dogs? i mean, not even puppies? |chandler|  is there a puppy here? 
tag| you don't like puppies? |chandler|  okay, you are new!
joey| look, chandler, i told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. it's like ross not likin ice cream. |phoebe| you don't like ice cream? 
ross| it's too cold. |chandler| okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. 
ross|  it hurts my teeth.|chandler| and i don't wanna say this, i don't want you guys to hate me, but uh, i don't think, i can be around that dog anymore. okay, so either the dog goes, or i go.  oh my god!!
ross| how can i not get this? i'm a college professor; i got 1450 on my s.a.t.s. |monica| 1250.
ross| damn, i forgot you were here. |phoebe| all right. we're gonna take clunkers to rosss. we'll be back in a minute. 
rachel| oh, wait before you guys go, can i just ask you a question? |monica| yeah. 
rachel| when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move? |phoebe| oh, i'd say about a month. 
monica| really? i'd say 3 to 4. |joey| half hour. 
rachel| interesting. |monica| when it's your assistant, i would say never. 
joey| all right, rach, the big question is, does he like you? all right? because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. |rachel| huh. a moo-point? 
joey| yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. it just doesn't matter. it's moo. |rachel|  have i been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
monica| please, don't listen to joey, okay. would you look at him? he-hes obviously depressed. he's away from his family; he's spending thanksgiving with strangers.  what he needs right now is for you to be his friend. |rachel| you're right, i'm sorry. thank you. okay, that's what i'm gonna do. 
joey| fine! take their advice. no one ever listens to me. when the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside. |rachel| hey! 
tag| hey. |rachel| how are you holding up? 
tag| not bad. |rachel| yeah? i'm sorry about your girlfriend. 
tag| thanks. |rachel| so were you guys together a long time? 
tag| a year. on and off. i kinda thought we'd end up together. i don't anymore. |rachel| now that she broke up with you? 
tag| yeah. |rachel| yeah. hmmmm. 
tag| it's weird. i always used to assume, that i would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. but lately it's like what if it's not. do you ever have that feeling? |rachel| noyeah, all the time, constantly. it's terrifying. but you know that i figure itit has to work out. 
tag| why? |rachel| because, uhit has to. 
tag| you have all the answers, don't you? |rachel| yeah, i know, i do. i really do. 
tag| hey, thanks for talking to me. |rachel| well, what is a boss for? hug it out!  
joey|  all right, he likes you back! huh? told ya, you should go for it! |tag| what? 
joey|  |tag| what did joey say? i like you back? 
rachel| uh, yeah, well, see, he joey knows, that i'm-i'm very insecure about my back and, andyou're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!|tag| wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense. 
rachel| no?  all right, here's the truth um, joey said what he said, because um, i'm attracted to you. |tag| wow.  
rachel| yeah, i admit it. i have a crush on you, and uh, and, and i know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing i want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now. |tag|  
rachel| what? |tag| right there! that's my car!  hey!! 
rachel| okay, that's gonna take them a minute. do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest? |tag| i can't believe this!  
rachel|  |monica| okay phoebe, we should probably go back now. 
phoebe|  please don't leave me, i'll be lonely. |monica| stop it. stop! okay let's go. we can be strong.
phoebe| yeah, okay. |monica| oh my god! did you hear that? she said monica!  oooh, i can't leave her! 
phoebe| you know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and chandler wouldn't even know. |monica| that's not gonna work. 
phoebe| i've had that dog there for three days and chandler had no idea. he's not so smart. |monica| hey! i didn't know either. 
phoebe| yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you? |monica| yeah, i knew. 
phoebe| where's chandler? |chandler|  here i am. 
phoebe| wash your hands!!!|chandler| how did youknow?  
ross| hey! what's she doing back here? |monica| relax, ross. she's not made of ice cream! 
ross| hey look, phoebe. i, uh, i laid out the states geographically... |phoebe|  no, no, we don't really have time for this right now. okay, we have to keep chandler away from my bedroom. 
ross| yeah, but, but look what i'm... |phoebe| see, this is exactly what we do not have time for.  
chandler|  where's monica? |ross| um, in phoebe's room. you can't go in there. 
chandler| why not? |ross| monica's crying. she's very upset about this whole clunkers thing. 
chandler| well, i, i should go in there. |ross| no. no, no. she doesn't want to see you right now. 
chandler| why not? |ross| because you sent away the dog!
chandler| this is ridiculous.  |ross| oh, is it? is it? look, when monica and i were kids, we had a dog named rover. and, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. so monica and her friendphyllistake away the dog. and that was the last time we ever saw him. don't you see? this is just like that. only with a few details changed. 
joey|  what's the matter? |chandler| monica's all upset, because i sent clunkers away. 
joey| so? bring the dog back, you're a hero. |chandler| yeah, i can be a hero, i could do that. i could, i could do... i, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? 
joey| chandler, it's like a big gerbil.|chandler| and that doesn't scare you?  
joey| ross, you need some help? |ross| from you?  yes, please! 
joey|  first of all, utah? dude, you can't just make stuff up!|ross| i hate america! when i finish this game, i swear i am moving. 
joey| hey! tag's still talking to the police. |rachel| yeah, ohh! why, damnit, why did i open my mouth?  gee, i-i know that i freaked him out 
joey| if you said it like that, you probably did, yeah. |phoebe|  hey, is chandler here? 
chandler| no, no he went for a walk. |phoebe| okay, but you cannot tell him... but look who's back! 
rachel|  hi! |joey| oh no-no-no-no-no-no-no! he went over to ross' to bring the dog back here! 
phoebe| oh no, the dog's not going to be there! |joey| you think? 
monica| hi, honey. |chandler| please, please, please, don't be mad at me. 
monica| what? why, why would... |phoebe|  shh, wait and see. maybe we will, maybe we won't. 
chandler| okay, i went over to ross' apartment to bring back clunkers. yknow, for you, and |phoebe| we have good news, look who's back! 
rachel|  hi! |chandler| clunkers?! oh my god! 
monica| that's right, she came back all by herself. |phoebe| it's a thanksgiving miracle! 
chandler|  it is so good to see you! |phoebe| yeah, she came all the way back from ross' building. oh, the things she must have seen! and then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in i went too far, didn't i? when should i have stopped? 
ross| okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. let me tell you something, i have 49 states, and there are no more! i-i think, i should be able to eat something. |chandler| it's up to you. 
rachel| oh, hi! how are you doing? |tag| i'm okay. i gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots. 
rachel| oh. |tag| thanks for having me over, you guys. 
ross| tag? y-you're going?  uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. uh, so, where did you say you're from again? |tag| colorado. 
ross| ah, what good are you.  |rachel| look, um, i think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. 
tag| okay. |rachel| ah, i-i never should have said what i said. ityknow what? it just doesn't matter how i feel. i mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what i would love is just to go to work on monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? big day monday lots to do. so, we're okay? 
tag| um, i'm not. |rachel| oh, god, i knew it, that i freaked you out. 
tag| no, you didn't. the only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us. |rachel| really? 
tag| yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.  |rachel| okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on monday. 
ross| delaware!  delaware!|chandler| all right.

ross|  what?!|phoebe| well, we didnt have a lot of money. but the girl across the street had the best bike! it was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
chandler| that sounds like my first bike.  my dad gave me his old one.|ross| ohh.
monica| did the girl ever let you ride it?|phoebe| no! but she gave me the box that it came in. it had a picture of the bike on the front.  so i would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
ross| that is so unfair!|phoebe| not really, i got to drag him around too! 
chandler| hey! what are you guys doing? |joey| hey.

phoebe| hey!|joey| here.  now i only owe you $49.50.
chandler| hey pheebs!|phoebe| hey! 
chandler| if you wanna give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?|monica| it's not just the drum noise. every five minutes, joey throws his sticks in the air, and i have to hear, \oh my eye! oh god, my eye!\ i mean, it is so annoying.
phoebe| yes, thank you. you see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.|monica| phoebe, you got joey drums to annoy rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
phoebe| maybe on some level.|rachel| joey, yknow that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
joey| what is rock 'n' roll about that?|phoebe| 
joey| oh wait, before you tell me what it is!  okay, what is it?|phoebe| it's atarantula!  oh! god! rachel, look, i'm sorry. what was i thinking giving joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
rachel| what are you talking about? i love them!  yeah, i had a tarantula when i was a kid. but it-it died, because my cat ate it. and then, then my cat died. but joey, isn't this cool?|joey| is it on me? i feel, i feel like it's on me! i got, hey! 
rachel| oh, isn't that adorable? joey is afraid of the tarantula.|phoebe| 
rachel| what? wait-wait a minute, what? phoebe, what's the matter?|phoebe| our apartment is ready.
rachel| and that makes you angry because|phoebe| because you would rather live here with joey.
rachel| where did you get that?|phoebe| monica and chandler said that you were having so much fun here. and apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
rachel| phoebe?|phoebe| hm?
rachel| did you get all this stuff for joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!|phoebe|  fish!
rachel| it wouldn't have mattered anyway, phoebe, you and i are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.|phoebe| yes, but i wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here
rachel| oh, it's so much more fun with you.|phoebe| we did have fun, didn't we?
rachel| we did!|phoebe| oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
rachel| oh, i would love to!|phoebe| yay, okay!
rachel| good, good, good, good, good. |phoebe| great, all right, okay, and monica ask me to make the drumming stop.

ross|  santa was unavailable so close to christmas.|monica| wow, come in, have a seat. you must be exhausted coming all the way fromtexas.
ben| texas?|ross| that's right, ben. i'm santa's representative for all the southern states. and mexico! but, santa sent me here to give you these presents, ben.  maybe the lady will help me with these presents.
ben| wow! thanks!|ross| you're welcome, ben. merry christmas, ooh, and happy hanukkah!
ben| are you for hanukkah, too? because i'm part-jewish.|ross|  you are? me, too!
monica| because armadillos also wandered in the desert?|ross|  ooh, hey ben, what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
ben| cool!|ross| yeah!
monica| come on ben.|ross| years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees...

chandler| hey! |ross| what are you doing here, santa?
chandler| well, i'm here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weirdturtle-man?|ross| i'm the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend. you sent me here to give ben some presents. remember?

ross|  what are you doing?|chandler| you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work!
ross| thank you, but, but you gotta leave.|chandler| why?
ross| because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you're-youre wrecking it.|chandler| but i didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
ross| i'm sorry, chandler but this, this is really important to me.|chandler| fine, i'll give the suit back.
monica| |chandler| santa? really?
monica| yes, is that okay?|chandler| did your dad ever dress up like santa?
monica| no.|chandler| then it's okay! 
ross| okay ben, santa has to go. say good-bye!|ben| no! why does he have to go?
chandler| because, if santa and the holidayarmadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. merry christmas!|ben| no! why can't the armadillo leave? i want santa!
ross| fine, i-i give up. santa, santa can stay.|chandler| well, i'll stay, but only because i wanna hear about hanukkah. ben, will you sit here with santa and learn about hanukkah?
ben| okay, santa!|ross| all right, it's time for the story of hanukkah. years and years ago, there were these people called the maccabees.

phoebe| oh me too.|rachel| i know.  oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? listen, im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give rachel the purple chair?
phoebe| no, i do not hear that.|ross| and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day, burned for
ben|  eight whole days.|ross| thats right, and thats why we celebrate hanukkah today. the end.
ben| awesome!|ross| yeah?
chandler| my favorite part was when superman flew all the jews out of egypt. |ross| the armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! okay ben, its time to light the hanukkah candles!

chandler|  it was at the front door. when i got home. somebody sent it to us.|rachel| chandler, this is not addressed to you. this is addressed to mrs. braverman downstairs.  thief.
chandler| ino! i didn't read the box before i opened it. and you can't return a box after you've opened the box.|rachel| why, why not?
chandler| because it's too delicious.|rachel| chandler, you stole this cheesecake. that is wrong.
chandler| no-no-no! it is going to be okay, because mrs. braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  i feel terrible, im a horrible, horrible, horrible person.|rachel|  oh, im sorry, what?
joey| all right, i should get going, big day at work. yknow im in a coma? today, they do this test on me and it turns out im not brain dead.|chandler| so

ross| thanks.  oh! so for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?|monica| what are you talking about?
ross| cousin frannies wedding, it's tomorrow night.|monica| you were invited?!
ross| no.|monica| my god, i cant believe this! i mean i knew that mom and dad were invited, but i thought that was it! i mean from the ages 7 to 9 frannie and i were inseparable!
chandler| well, maybe since the age of 9, frannies made some new friends.|ross| well l-look okay, its probably just a mistake. let me call aunt sheryl okay? maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
monica| yeah, well you call her and tell her that yknow when we were kids her precious little frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? and if i hadnt have stopped her, there probably wouldnt even be a wedding to go to.|ross| yknow, she tried to undress me too.
chandler| i used to undress my cousin glenn. |phoebe| joseph francis tribbiani are you home yet?!!
rachel| umm, i think hes still out. whats wrong?|phoebe| well, ill tell you rachel karen green, i had plans with joey tonight and he left me this note. 
rachel|  big daddy?|phoebe| oh thats a nickname we were trying out.
ross| hey, yknow what nickname never caught on? the ross-a-tron! |joey|  hey!
phoebe| oh! heres joseph francis!|joey| oh-wha-ho! what are you middle naming me for?! i left you a note!
phoebe| so what?! that doesnt give you the right to ditch me!|joey| hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
ross| phoebe hes right, that is the rule.|phoebe| i dont accept this rule. when we make plans, i expect you to show up. okay, i cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better! yknow boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!
joey| wow! im so sorry; i had no idea it would bother you this much.|phoebe| well, it does.
joey| okay, can i-can i make it up to you? huh? im sorry.  how about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! ill pay for myself!|phoebe| okay, you wore me down.
ross| hey joe, while youre over there how about another beer for the ross-a-tron?|joey| the rossis that back?!! 
rachel| hi!|chandler| another cheesecake came! they delivered it to the wrong address again!
rachel| so just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?|chandler| i cant seem to say goodbye.
rachel| are you serious?! chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?|chandler| well ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
rachel| it was cheesecake. it was fine. it had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  wow! my whole mouth just filled with saliva! |chandler|  yknow what? forget it! we are just hungry! we have not had lunch! we are just light-headed! so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
rachel| yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted.|chandler| good idea. where do you want to go to lunch?
rachel| mommas little bakery, chicago, illinois. |joey| awww! mel torme died.
monica| joey, that papers like a year old!|joey| aw! does that mean the sam goodys sale is over?!
ross|  hey.|joey| hey.
monica| hey.|ross| so i finally heard back from aunt sheryl and apparently it wasnt a mistake. ahh, theres-theres limited seating in the hall.
monica| limited seating?!  i am just one tiny person!|ross| well yeah, but she doesnt know that. i mean, the last time she saw you-you wouldve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling. 
monica|  limited seating! oh, that is such a lame excuse! thats not the reason shes not inviting me!|ross| oh whats the big deal?! i wasnt even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. and-and yknow what? if it makes you feel any better, joan and i will just make an appearance and then, and then well-well leave early as a sign of protest.
monica| joan?|ross| yeah, joan tedeski my date. shes an assistant professor in the linguistics department. tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
monica| wait a minute, you got ross gellar and guest?! i wasnt invited and you got \and guest?!\|joey| uh-uh, excuse me, i do have to interrupt on rosss behalf. i-i think the rule applies here yknow, since she has a chance to get on broad back
ross|  not broad backed!|monica| wait a minute, yknow, youre bringing me!
ross| what? i cant cancel on joan!|monica| why not?!
ross| becdid you not hear me?! shes an assistant professor in the linguistics department, okay? theyre wild! why do you want to come anyway?|monica| because! shes my cousin. i mean, we grew up together! were family yknow? well thats important to me.
ross| okay, all right, ill take you. ill go call joan. |joey| aww thats nice. family should be there, huh? this is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
monica|  well see.|chandler| well, thank you for lunch.
rachel| what? wait a minute, i didnt pay, i thought you paid!|chandler| so apparently we just dont pay for food anymore.  do you see what i see?
rachel| |chandler| mrs. braverman must be out. 
rachel| she could be out of town. maybe shell be gone for months.|chandler| by then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. we dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
rachel| no that could kill her.|chandler| well, we dont want that.
rachel| no, so were protecting her.|chandler| but we should take it.
rachel| but we should move quick.|chandler| why?

rachel| stevie the tv?|joey|  is there a problem?
rachel| no!  you bitch!|ross| hey, yknow whats weird? after you guys get married, when you introduce me to people youre gonna have to say, \this is my brother-in-law ross.\ not, \my friend ross,\ \brother-in-law ross.\ thats weird isnt it?

monica|  hey ross! so, i was checking out the uh, real estate section|ross| yeah?

ross|  who did you leave a message with?|chandler| 
rachel| joey, joey i am so sorry.|joey| i told you not to move it! rach, how would you feel if say, i wanted to move your mom, and you said dont, and i did it anyway and her head fell off?

ross| i cant believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. man, some-some strangers gonna be living in my room.|monica| well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, its time the velvet ropes came down.
ross| they kept your room for a while.|monica| oh please! dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after i moved out! i gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of victorias secret catalogues, not a gym!
ross| come on, you know they love you.|monica| as much as they love you?
ross| i was their first born! they thought she was barren! its not my fault.|phoebe|  hey.
ross| hey.|monica| hey!
phoebe| ugh, i hate this year!|ross| whats wrong with this year?
phoebe| well okay, its already february and ive only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!|monica| that was me and ross.
phoebe| oh thats right!|ross| hey, yknow if you want to pick up some extra cash? some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
monica| oh thats a great idea. youre really good on the phone.|phoebe| yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job i had. yknow, i probably wouldnt have to say spank as much.  
ross| what?|phoebe| oh yeah, like you never called!
supervisor| so basically this is very easy. you read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.|phoebe| okay, i can do that! oh, by the way, i love my office.
supervisor|  why dont we do a trial run.|phoebe| oh okay. umm, all right.  hi, this is phoebe from empire office supplies, can i speak to your supply manager please?
supervisor| im the supply manager.|phoebe| umm, okay i would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
supervisor| we dont need any toner.|phoebe| oh okay, well im sorry to bother you. bye-bye.  yeah youre right, this is easy.
supervisor| okay, what was wrong with that call?|phoebe| oh well, all rightum, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
supervisor| theyre always going to tell you they dont need toner, but thats okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.|phoebe| oh.
supervisor| so, i think youre ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?|phoebe| no.  oh wait yes! i do, i do have one question. what is toner?
chandler| joey! joe! |ross| dad?
mr. geller| im here!|ross|  hey!
mr. geller| hi. god, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.|ross| dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.
mr. geller| well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.|ross|  lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
mr. geller| im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.|monica| oh, thats okay, i cant wait to see everything again! all of the memories
mr. geller| well, i dont know whats in the boxes down here, but i do know there are six or seven easy bake ovens in the attic.|monica| i used to love to play restaurant.
ross| yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.|monica| hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies! 
mr. geller| so, i think your boxes are over here. |ross| wow! great!  wait, dad who-whos cigarettes are these?
mr. geller| i dont know. they-they must be your mothers, but please, please dont ask her. ill throw these away. |ross| cool! dad! my report cards! hey, check this out dad,  oooh, my rock polisher!
mr. geller| oh look, look theres your old makeup kit!|ross| its a clown kit! clown kit!
mr. geller| well, the white seems to be untouched.  uh-oh.|ross| what?
mr. geller| yknow how the garage floods every spring?|ross| how are you ever going to sell this place?
mr. geller| i think i accidentally used monicas boxes to keep the water away from the porsche.|ross| oh no. dad! dad! what oh godeverythings ruined! dad, shes gonna be crushed!
mr. geller| you dont secretly smoke do you?|ross| no!
mr. geller| so its just your mother then.|phoebe|

earl| okay, sono toner today. thanks anyway, bye-bye.|phoebe| no-no wait-wait! i cant just let you hang up! just please talk to me.
earl| welli only have one thing to do today.  i guess i could push it back.|phoebe| yeah! now, why do you want to kill yourself?
earl| its just that i uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows i exist!|phoebe| chandler?
earl| i-im sorry?|phoebe| no look, i-im sure that people know you exist!
earl| oh yeah? i work in a cubicle surrounded by people. ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk. hang-hang on.  ehh, nothing. nothing.|chandler| my chair. now, if anybody asks, your name is rosita! 
rachel| you will like it!|joey| no i wont.
rachel| you dont even know!|joey| because, i know what i like and what i dont like! its not the same thing!
rachel| well look, if you dont like this|joey| i dont know why you say that so soon.
rachel| come on joey, i just bought you a new chair! the most expensive one in the store! hey, yknow what i was thinking? we could name her francette.|joey| francette? what is she? a couch?
joey| poor thing. cut down in her prime.|rachel| joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. maybe we should actually move rosita out of here. yknow, start the healing process?
joey| well, i guess youre right. maybe, maybe ill take her down to the incinerator. its gonna be so sad, and kinda cool.  shes healed!|rachel| thats weird.
joey| no its not weird, its a miracle!|rachel| its not a miracle joey! im sure theres some explanation.
joey| oh there is! if you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!|rachel| joey, i really dont
joey|  can you tell me how this happened?|rachel| well no.

joey| someone like anangel?|rachel| thats right joey, the chair angel came in and healed your chair. 
joey| |mr. geller| well, shell understand right? its not like i did it on purpose.
ross| dad, that wont matter to her. look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff! see, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.|mr. geller| oh my god, does she really thinks that?
ross| well, can you blame her?|mr. geller| well i dont know, i-i suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! the doctor said your mother could
ross| dad, dad i dont want to hear about it.|mr. geller| really?
ross| well, not right now. okay look, monica came here for some memories and damnit, were gonna give her some! okay, grabgrab some empty boxes. okay? well-well take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers well-well put em in there. |mr. geller| great!

phoebe| earl, youre not hearing me! all im saying is that youre not alone, alright? everybody hates the people they work with! |guy|  hey guy!
phoebe| wait, what was that? that sounded like someone being nice to you.|earl| no! thats just the \hey guy\ guy. he says that to everybody! hes the worst! id like to take him with me!
phoebe| all right. so earl, lets just forget about the people at the office, okay? there-theres gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! what about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?|earl|  yeah! right!
phoebe| oh sorry, boyfriend!|earl| oh no.
phoebe| no, whatever! anything!|phoebe| yeah, hes gotta go.
earl| okay, i should, i should probably be getting back to my thing now. see ya. |phoebe| no! im not finished yet! dont! dont you dare hang up on me!!!
supervisor|  the new girls good.|monica| hey guys! hey!
ross| hey.|monica| hey, i just whipped us up some easy bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.

monica|  okay. so, which boxes are mine?|ross| well, these. these are yours right here. 
monica| okay. |ross| yeah. yeah, oh you loved that thing. you always had it with you. you never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.

monica|  oh, an old glove?|mr. geller| oh, yeah you loved that glove! you took it every place you went. you never went any place without that glove.
monica| wow! look at this! |ross| oh, i dont know how that got in there.
monica|  these are your boxes! where are my boxes?|ross| umm, your boxes are umm
monica| what?|ross| dad?
mr. geller| well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. im sorry.|monica| just mine?
mr. geller| im afraid so.|monica| so why-why wasnt rosss stuff ruined?  and if you say the words medical marvel im going to easy bake your head!
mr. geller| well, i used your boxes to divert water away from the porsche.|monica| so wait, rosss stuff is fine, but i have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
mr. geller| there was also leaves and guk and stuff.|monica| i cant believe this! 
mr. geller| |rachel| hey chandler!
chandler| hey!|rachel| how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
chandler| yeah, id love to but ive tried that so many times they wont even let me in the store anymore.|rachel| well what if i told you you can do it in my apartment?
chandler|  are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? the chair that sit magazine called the chair of the year?|rachel| i just purchased the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000. 
chandler| thats awesome! thats great! what made you do it?!|rachel| well, its a long story, but umm i broke joeys chair
chandler| whoa-whoa-whoa! you broke joeys chair?|rachel| yeah.
chandler| i thought i broke joeys chair! thats why i replaced it with mine!|rachel| ohhhhh. thats how it got fixed!
chandler| well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?|rachel| noo!  angels.
chandler| im gettin my chair back! |rachel| what? wh-hey!
joey| well, it looks like it wasnt healed after all! yeah! so, i guess this chair is mine now! |chandler| joey you broke my chair!!
joey| your chair?!|rachel| yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
joey| so, there was no miracle?!|rachel| no joe, no miracle.
joey|  oh no this is devastating! my faith is shaken. im so glad i have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.|rachel| uh-huh! nice try, but you dont get that chair anymore! all right? that is my chair now! you can sit on my lap!  no i take that back!
chandler| i think i should get the chair!|joey| how do you figure?
chandler| because you  broke a chair! the only one around here that hasnt broke a chair, is me!|rachel| no-no-no! this chairs not going anywhere.
chandler| well, wheres the logic in that?!|rachel| the logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
chandler| so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing!|joey| thats right!
chandler| what are you guys? like a gang or something?!|joey| yeah! we are!

phoebe| no-no i cant! i cant let you do it!|earl| why?!
phoebe| because it was fate that made me call you today!|earl| i thought it was toner.
phoebe| no! think about it okay? this isnt even my regular job! okay? and my first day on the job, youre my first call! and-and somebody else mightve hung up on you, but i wouldnt do that because i know about this stuff. my mom killed herself.|earl| really?!
phoebe| yes.|earl| how?
phoebe| im not gonna give you tips! look dont you see that this-thisthis all came together so that i could stop you from doing this.|earl| couldnt it just be a coincidence?
phoebe| no, its fate!|earl| it doesnt really seem like enough to be fate.
phoebe| oh. well umm, okay heres a weird thing. my mother was also a supply manager.|earl| im actually the office manager.
phoebe| oh my god! so was she! and! get this, okay? your-your name is earl, right? her name was pearl, p-earl.|earl| well, was there anything else?!

chandler| monicas wasted.|ross| maybe that will liven up this party.
chandler|  okay, will you just go help her change please!|rachel| okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for joey.
joey| yep. |tag|  this ones from me.
rachel| ahh!|tag| it wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun.
rachel| |ross|  stick to the list. always stick to the list.
rachel| no! no-no, i love it. thank you.  |chandler| okay, open ours next. open ours next!
rachel| okay.|joey| now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys?
chandler| for my last birthday you gave me a hug!  okay, read the card! read the card!|rachel| okay.  thats funny, yeah!
chandler| no-no-no-no! that was the joke!|rachel|  no, i know! i get it! its funny!
chandler| no, because youre not a grandmother!|rachel| no i know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and i dont have any of those things. thats why its so funny. 
monica| all you had to do was buy the card!|ross| hey! look whos back! its the birthday girl! hows the birthday girl feeling?
rachel| well, i feel fine, but i think youre bumming out the rest of the kids.|ross| what? 
rachel| okay! yknow what? i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. all i really needed was a plan. see i wanna have three kids|phoebe| oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
rachel| as i was saying i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time im 35 which gives me five years. i love this plan! i wanna marry this plan!|phoebe| if you could do that, id marry the hippity-hop.
rachel| so, if i wanna have my kid when im 35, i dont have to get pregnant until im 34. which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes! oh wait, but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant|monica| really! that long?!  look all you want, its happening!
rachel| no, so i dont have to get married until im 33! thats three years, thats three whole yearsoh, wait a minute though. ill need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and id like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged which means i need to meet the guy by the time im thirty.|ross| which is fine! because you just turnedtwenty-eight!
rachel| no! ross, no! it is not fine! eh-eh-according to my plan i should already be with the guy i wanna marry!|joey| will you quit hoggin it!
rachel|  im telling you its like watching bambi learn how to walk.|ross|  youre drunk! mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! maybe im a little drunk.
chandler|  there we go.|joey|  did i not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
chandler|  how are you feeling?|monica| you are so handsome! i wanna make love to you right here, right now! 
ross| i really wish that you wouldnt.|chandler|  now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? then we can put you in bed, okay? just smile and dont talk to anyone.
phoebe|  speech! speech! lets hear from the birthday girl! huh?|chandler| pheebs!!
phoebe| dont you see? everyones looking at me! the plans working! i didnt even have to take off my top yet!|mrs. geller| speech! come on monica!

phoebe| plus, it totally ruined my schedule! ii havent done any of the things i wanted to do by the time i was 31!|joey| like what?
phoebe| like okay i-i-i, i havent met any portuguese people! i, i havent had the perfect kiss! and i havent been to snipers school!|monica| phoebe, yknow why dont we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?

rachel| yeah, its just yknow|chandler|  monica said wedding.
monica| uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.|rachel| oh! i would love to read a poem.
chandler| do you think you could get through a poem?|rachel|  itll be a short one.
monica| okay, so ross will be doing the reading.|rachel| ohhh
ross| okay. yeah, i guess, i guess i could do that too.|chandler| too?
ross| yeah, i kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.|monica| do you mind telling us what it is?
ross| sorry, im kinda keeping this one on the q.t.|chandler| well, whatever it is, i hope it involves winking. 
joey|  hey!|all| hey!
joey| so i just talked to one of the dool writers today, and|monica| what is dool?
joey| days of our lives. anyway, youre not gonna believe it! my character is coming out of his coma!!|all| oh!!
chandler| thats great!|joey| and-and-and not only that, im gettin a new brain!!
chandler| so great things are happening at work and in your personal life!|rachel| wait, what do you mean youre getting a new brain?
joey| oh well, theyre killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.|ross| what? a brain transplant?!
joey|  yes, its a highly controversial procedure.|ross| its ridiculous!
joey| well, i think its ridiculous that you havent had sex in three and a half months.|ross| 
monica| who are they killing off?|joey| uh cecilia monroe, she plays jessica lockhart.
rachel and monica| noo!!|monica| shes my favorite character on dool.
joey| nice.|rachel| she is so good at throwing drinks in peoples faces, i mean i dont think ive ever seen her finish a beverage.
monica| and the way she slaps all the time!|rachel| oh!
monica| wouldnt you love to do it just once?! |chandler| dont do it.
rachel| cecilia monroe man, what a great actress.|joey| oh, tell me about it. and shes been on the show forever, its gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
ross| yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the \brain transplant,\ you are going to be her?|joey| yes, but in drake ramorays body.  why is this so hard for you to get? i thought you were a scientist!
phoebe|  rach, so, that guy there. straight or gay?|rachel|  well, i'd have to say gay.
phoebe| yeah? why?|rachel| well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
phoebe| oh no not that guy there. that guy right there. |rachel| oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
phoebe| |rachel| all right, straight, and not subtle. 
phoebe| ohh, he left his cell phone.|rachel| oh, well, we can hand it to gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
phoebe| or we could use it to call china. see how those guys are doing.|rachel| what if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fall in love. i mean wouldn't that be a great story? kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
phoebe| yeah that does sound great. i'm going to get the phone. |rachel| what? wait! whywhy do you get the story?
phoebe| i don't know. i haven't been out on a date in so long.|rachel| phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
phoebe| that wasnt a date! that was, that was just friends getting together having sex.|rachel| okay. okay, see? i get the phone.
phoebe| no way! no way! you just broke with tag a week ago.|rachel| yeah!  and until now, i didnt think id love again.
phoebe| nice try.|rachel| oh hey-hey wait! how do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
phoebe| i dont know. |rachel| well umm, maybe we could uhh  ah-ha! too slow!! 
phoebe| ah-ha! too cocky!|dina| im going to keep dating him mother, and theres nothing you can do about it!
jessica lockhart| oh yes there is!|dina| what are you going to do? kill him? like you did with charles?!
jessica lockhart|  that was an accident! and so were you.|dina| well, at least im not a murderer! 
jessica lockhart| |the director| cut!
joey| that was a great scene! and-and-and that slap looks so real! how do you do that?|cecilia| oh, just years of experience.
dina|  can i get some ice here?!|joey| oh anyway, i just wanted to say how wonderful i think you are.
cecilia| youre not the fan whos dying are you?|joey| say what?
cecilia| im supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but thats not supposed to be until  later!|joey| no. no, im joey tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. i-im the guy in the coma!
cecilia| oh that was a real person?!|joey| an-an-anyway i-i just wanted to say that since im getting your brain when you leave the show, i was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
cecilia| i-i-im leaving the show?|joey|  i dont know. why? did you hear something?
cecilia| who told you that?|joey| oh uh, one of the writers.
cecilia| which one? was it bald or was it tall?|joey| umm
cecilia| yknow what? it doesnt matter! because it is not true!|joey| okay.
cecilia| and if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that ive been playing for 20 yearsill give you a tip! |joey| ms. monroe 
rachel| no phoebe! you cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair! okay look, i have an idea. why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. and then whoever does gets the phone.|phoebe| or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
rachel| i dont think so.|phoebe|  fine all right, but id bet youd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
rachel|  all right, first name on the speed dial is mom.|phoebe| ohh, i lost my mom to suicide.
rachel| okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.|phoebe| did i use that already today? im sorry.
rachel| yes okay.  joe. carlos. peter. ooh! peter luger! t hats a steak house!|phoebe| okay, a meat eater. fine, thats one for you.
rachel|  oh, i win! hes got barneys on his speed dial.|phoebe| so you dont know thats barneys the store! that can be yknow his friends house, or a bar. who has barneys the store on their speed dial?
rachel|  his new girlfriend!|monica| what is that?
chandler| i think its the dying cat parade.|monica| it sounds like its coming from across the street.
chandler|  oh my god!|monica| what?
chandler| yknow that thing that ross was gonna do at our wedding?! he was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, \youre half scottish right?\|monica| nooo!!
chandler| yes!!|monica| no, there is no way! it can not be ross!  unbelievable! why is your family scottish?!
chandler| why is your family ross?!|monica| he cannot play at our wedding! i mean everyone will leave! i mean come on, that is just noise! its not even a song!
chandler| if you listen very carefully, i think its celebration by cool and the gang.|rachel| hi pheebs!
phoebe| hi!|rachel| how are ya?
phoebe| good.|rachel| umm pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that i was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone?
phoebe| yeah.|rachel| and remember how i said i was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang i could just pick it up?
phoebe| yeah!|rachel| and do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
phoebe| ooh, now you lost me.|rachel| you stole the phone!
phoebe| no i didnt!|rachel| no? so youre saying that if i called it, it wouldnt ring?
phoebe| no. umm, okay. but while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. |rachel| phoebe!
phoebe| that is a different phone.|rachel| oh is it?!  its for me!
phoebe| that is damning evidence.|rachel| oh my god! i bet thats him. my digital fairy tale is about to begin. i wonder how i should be? should i be uh  would you stop doing that?!
phoebe|  yes, im the one who found your phone.|rachel| phoebe! you cant do th
phoebe| |rachel| you do know that i will be here when he comes over.
phoebe| oh? and how will you know what time to come over?|rachel| you just said it!
phoebe| oh. okay, well i-i was kinda hoping that i would justbe alone yknow to think about my mom and her suicide.|rachel| oh phoebe!
phoebe| what?! thats the first time today!|rachel| ohh! 
joey| so you like the nachos uh? myself im partial to|dina|  im 16.
joey| see you in 2003. |cecilia|  youre absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. they dont know exactly when its going to happen, but apparently it's going to be very soon and thats it.
joey| im so sorry. look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.|cecilia| yeah, thanks.
joey| no i mean it! i cant believe they would do this to you! and to your fans! i mean they are going to be devastated! heart broken! they love you so much!|cecilia| oh youre right. thank you! whats your name again?
joey| joey.|cecilia| joey, well thank you. that is so sweet. oh, excuse me. 
the writer| it wasnt my decision!|cecilia|  you were saying?
joey| uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-yel-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that i, that i came up to you before was because well, im really nervous about-about being you. yknow if you can help me capture the essence of the character. yknow? help me keep jessica alive. please?|cecilia| all right joey, i will help you. not because i-i owe it to this stupid show, but because i owe it to jessica.
joey| oh thats great! oh thank you so much!|cecilia| youre so welcome.
joey| hey! now, ive been watching some tapes, hows this?  \jessica lockhart will never set foot in this place again! ever!!\|cecilia| is that supposed to be me?
joey| yeah.|cecilia| yeah but jessica doesnt have an english accent.
joey|  i can do an english accent?! that babys going on my rsum!|chandler| well, i feel like a snack!
monica| do you want some shortbread? eh thats scottish like you are.|chandler| oh no thanks. i dont like anything from my scottish heritage.
ross| what?!|chandler| well its just my entire family was run out of scotland byvikings. anyway, lots of bad memories. 
ross| oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its scottish roots.|monica| no! no-no theyre not. theyre still very angry! but yknow chandler is also half-swedish. you know what the swedish people are famous for? sitting down and being quiet.
ross| well yeah-yeah the scottish history is so much more|monica|  you can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
ross| how did you know about that?!|chandler| we heard you play all the way from your apartment!
ross| were you the ones called the cops?!|chandler| thats not really important right now. what is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
ross| why not?|chandler| because we hate them.
ross| come on thats not fair! i mean you havent even heard me play!|chandler| we have heard you play.
ross| no, youve heard my practice. okay? just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. and im not going to tell you what song im gonna play either. but uh, lets just say when its over ill bet there will be a wee bit o celebration.|cecilia| so, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. so, when jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room.  you try.
joey| okay!  all right!|cecilia| no, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! hes not finding it out for the first time! so, try it again.
joey| okay. okay. |cecilia| right. hes not angry at the room either. try it again, he owns it! he owns the room. it is his. he owns, owns, owns, owns the room! he owns it!!  oh well, im gonna miss this woman so much. i dont know what im going to do! i mean, its been 20 years of my life.
joey| oh wellhey-hey! maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. yknow? itll-itll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. youre so talented.|cecilia| i am. i am, but i dont know, you know. an actor of a certain age is not that easy.
joey| hey thats not true! look at uh, look at angela lansbangelina jolie!|cecilia| i probably shouldve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but yknow i just got so comfy here! and ohh, i turned down some amazing work!
joey| like-like what?|cecilia| well, lets just say if i left 15 years ago, the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today!
joey|  wow!|cecilia| but well now, nows a different time for me. 
joey| oh hey come on, dont-dont-dont do this! umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? now when i watch you do a scene, im thinking, \boy, she-she is a great actress!\  uh but-but, i am also thinking, \she is hot!\|cecilia|  you think im hot?
joey| you own the room.  we should probably get-get uh|cecilia| oh yeah-yeah, we should get the 
joey| yeah-yeah, i noticed that! is that cause shes so passionate?|cecilia| no! its because that way the camera only sees her!  do you wanna try it?
joey| yeah! okay. |cecilia| that was good, that was really good. but i-i think your hands may be a little off, they should be maybe right like 
rachel| hey! hey!|phoebe and rachel|  who is it?

chandler| but i love swing music!|phoebe| yeah but the swing kings? yknow they suck so much that people actually die at their concertsthey just stop living.
chandler| look all i know is when monica and i went to see them, we had fun! and theres another reason too.|rachel| well, what is the other reason?
chandler| i dont want to say.|rachel| well you have to because maybe its stupid.

ross| so they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.|kristen| oh great!

ross| so joey umm, you look familiar. are uh, are you on tv or something?|kristen| well joey doesnt like to talk about it but, hes one of the stars of days of our lives.
ross| thats right! thats right, dont you play a woman?|joey| a woman in a mans body.
ross| much better.|joey| so yknow ross its funny cause, you look familiar to me too. have you ever been married?
ross| well yes, yes i have. in fact umm, just the other day kristen and i were talking about how ive been married and how i have a son.|kristen| yeah, little eric.
ross| thats right! wait no, ben.|joey| so youve just married the one time then?
ross| well umm|kristen| youve been married twice?
ross| yes. and another time after that. boy im getting hungry! hey joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you ate some of her food?|kristen| you said the waiter ate my crab cake.
joey|  yeah. so uh ross, well nowwhy did that first marriage breakup? was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?|kristen| do you two know each other?
joey and ross| no. no.|joey| no. it just seems like ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
ross| wait a minute! were you on a poster for gonorrhea?|joey| have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
ross| hey you leave marcel out of this!|joey| fine! have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!

chandler|  hi! nice to meet you!|cassie| nice to meet you too.
monica| so, are you ready to go?|cassie| yeah.
monica|  chandler!|chandler| ill be right with you.
monica|  cassie needs to stay at your place.|ross| whatwhy?
monica| because purvy perverson over here cant stop staring at her.|ross| what?! chandler, shes our cousin!
chandler| i was not staring at her. okay? i was just listening intently. its called being a good conversationalist. watch.  say something.|monica| you were staring about eight inches south of there.
ross| fine, she can stay at my place. by the way, what-what does cassie even look like now.|monica| she looks exactly like aunt marilyn.
chandler| umm, so this aunt marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?|monica| wafer thin ice!
joey| hey, im back!|the casting director| hi-hi joey.
joey| uh so, will-will i be reading the same scene again?|the casting director| actually, i tried to call you. you didnt need to come down here today.
joey| oh great! yknow i wouldve been perfect for this part, but whatever! yknow, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! good day! |the casting director| wait joey! you didnt need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
joey| and scene! huh? wasnt that fun? we did a little improv there. yeah! okay! so you-you-you-you were saying?|the casting director| well, the director thinks youre really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
joey| wow! sure! thats great!|the casting director| oh, and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
joey| yeah! yeah sure, just so long as its handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.|the casting director| terrific! well uh, theres one more thing. uhh, uh its really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. yeah, and so in your love scene with sarah she talks about how shes never seen a naked man who wasnt jewish. so 
joey| sowhat?|the casting director| so uh well, the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not jewish. do you know what im saying?
joey| yes!|the casting director| okay.
joey| no. what?|the casting director| an italian catholic immigrant at this time would not be
joey|  barmitsvahed?|monica| so to get this part you cant be?
joey| nope.|monica| but you are?
joey| yep.|monica| but you told them you werent?
joey| thats right.|monica| wow! wow! and its definitely all gone? theres nothing there to work with?  what were you thinking?
joey| i dont know! i really want this part! and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell em you can! and just figure out how to do it later.|monica| joey! this is not like learning to ride a horse! this is like learning togrow a turtleneck!
joey| i kn-i know! i know! okay? and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.|monica| oh my god, what are you gonna do?!
joey| i just have to call my agent and tell her i cant do the part. |monica| unless!
joey| unless what?|monica| well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
joey| like what?|monica| well im not sure yet, but umm, off the top of my head im thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
phoebe| hey! ive got a great idea for party favors for the shower. okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyones names in them and inside is everyones individual birth stone.|rachel| okay. okay. all right, you take care of that. and meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still dont have a guest list.
phoebe| okay. okay! well okay, who do we know thats coming? me. are you?|monica|  hey!

rachel| yeah, it was senior year in college. it was after the sigma chi luau and melissa and i got very drunk! and we ended up kissing! for several minutes! |phoebe|  which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.

joey| i dont know. just uh, just tell em it was a mix-up with the invitations, orno-no-no! blame it on the post office. they hate the post office. and the irish! but i dont think you can blame it on them, so |monica|

chandler|  look at her go! she must love me more than i love her! whats wrong with me? ooh, dont open that door.|chandler|  there are no words! this should not be this hard!
joey| all right, uh  oh hey, youve done this before ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?|ross| well with carol, i promised never to love another woman until the day i die. she made no such promise.

phoebe| what?!|rachel| what is the emergency?!
monica| you have to help me! im supposed to be writing my vows and all i have is this! |rachel| well, i like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
monica| thank you.|phoebe| yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. 
monica| those are my eyes! those are my breasts. |phoebe| oh! yeah! 
ross| well, why dont you just start with something simple. like umm, monica from the moment i met you, i knew i loved you.|chandler| yeah, im not sure i can do that.
ross| ...everyone, this is chandler!|fat monica| hi, i'm ross's little sister.
chandler|  okay.|rachel| okay. okay. okay. umm, maybe you can start with, \chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew i wanted more.\
chandler| all right, theres a nuclear holocaust, im the last man on earth. would you go out with me?|monica| ennnh.
monica| ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!|phoebe| well maybe you dont talk about your feelings back then. maybe you just say something about, yknow, all the things that hes taught you. like  or all the things you taught him.
monica| now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. , five, six, and seven!|chandler|  thats one?
monica| its kind of an important one!|chandler| oh, yknow-yknow what, i was looking at it upside down.
rachel| well, yknow, sometimes that helps. |monica| all right. umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 
joey| oh, i got it! how about saying something like, \monica|chandler|  monica

monica| oh yeah? when?|chandler| all right. i'll tell you what. when we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and i get together and have one?
monica| why won't i be married when i'm 40?|chandler| oh, no, no. i just meant hypothetically.
monica| ok, hypothetically, why won't i be married when i'm 40?|chandler| no, no, no.
monica| what is it? is there something fundamentally unmarriageable about me?|chandler|  uh, uh.
monica| well?|chandler| dear god! this parachute is a knapsack!

phoebe| okay, i can fix this! okay monica, rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. |monica| great! well rachel, the reason why i wont let you drive the porsche is because youre a terrible driver. there! that wasnt about the wedding.

ross| what?!  give-give me a brush.|rachel| gimme the keys!

chandler| no-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youd have to come up with a whole new word for what i went through. when i was in high school, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different hollywood starlet. yknow its hard enough to be fourteen. youre skinny. youre wearing speedosthat your mom promised that you would grow into! and you look up into the stands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as carmen miranda. he was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!|monica| hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! okay? thats a, thats a pretty great dad.
chandler| he had sex with mr. garibaldi!|monica| whos mr. garibaldi?
chandler| does it matter?!|monica| chandler, youre not fourteen anymore. okay? maybe its time that you let that stuff go. if your fathers not at your weddingyoure gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
chandler| yeah o-okay, but im just doing this for you.|monica| yes!
chandler| so i really never get to win anymore?|monica| how much did ever really win before?

joey| thats weird!|phoebe| im wearing his briefs right now.
joey| thatskinda hot.|phoebe| i think so too. and that little flap? great for holding my lipstick.
joey| yeah, i wouldnt know about that.|phoebe| and! yknow what jake says? that womens underwear is actually more comfortable. and he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
joey| yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!|phoebe| there is nothing wrong with jake! okay? he is all man! im thinking even more than you.
joey| oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.|phoebe| im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear! i dont think you could ever do that.
joey| hey! i am secure with my masculinity.|phoebe| okay, whatever.

monica| all right fine! if it means that much to you! but justtheres gonna be a ton left over.|joey| no there wont! i promise i will finish that turkey!
monica| all right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?|joey| thats right! cause im a tribbiani!  and this is what we do! i mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! we can eat!

rachel| so who else was in this club?|ross| uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from thailand but i-i dont think he-he knew what it was.
rachel| so ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an i hate rachel club.|will| you went out with her?! we had a pact!
ross| that was in high school! its not like it was binding forever.|will| then why did it have the word eternity in it?
rachel| okay monica, did you know about this?!|monica| i swear i didnt.  hey! is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
ross and will| yeah.|monica| hmm, a little relieved, i gotta say.
ross| look rach i-im sorry, okay? ii was a stupid kid, okay? the only reason i joined|will| co-founded!
ross| co-founded. co-founded the club was because i was insanely in love with you. obviously i didnt handle it very well. but if you think about it the i hate rachel club was really the i love rachel club.|will| uh, except that it was really the i hate rachel club.
rachel| okay. so what? you guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?|will| well, we did a little more than that.
ross| no-no! no-no. no-no.|phoebe| what?! what else did you do?

monica| everyone at our school heard it!|chandler| everybody at my school heard it! you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from long island?!

rachel| monica, how come you never told me this?!|monica| i thought it might be true. and i was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.

rachel|  okay! okay! listen to what sean mcmahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, \dear rach, youre such a good person.\ not girl! person!|ross| rach, i think youre reading a little too much into it.
rachel| |ross| look, what do you want me to do? do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasnt true?!
rachel| yes!|will| could you also tell them im skinny now?
monica| oh! me too!|ross| well look-look im not calling anybody! okay? it was like a million years ago!
rachel| i dont care how long ago it was! you told people that i was half and half! yknow what? i just want to point out i never did anything to hurt you in high school.|monica| thats not totally true.
rachel| what?|ross| what?

chandler| did she look 16?|rachel| ohh, theres a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
phoebe| oh!  wow!|ross| she didnt photograph well!
chandler| well, she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!|phoebe| so how did this happen? did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
ross| i was working late in the library one afternoon. it was just the two of us. she needed some help with her word jumble. and one thing led to another. if you must know, anita was very gentle and tender. may she rest in peace|monica| didnt she walk with a cane?

monica| all right, listen youre just being silly. rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. one girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a tootsie roll!|rachel| wow
monica| and ross, if it werent for rachels rumor i mean no one in high school would even know who you were. she put you on the map!|ross| as a romancer of the elderly.
monica| hey! mrs. altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.|ross| the eyesdid still sparkle.
monica| hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. you-youve been through so much since then. and right now youve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. cant you just let this go?|rachel| shes right.

ross| and smart!|rachel| popular.
ross| with an aptitude for science.|phoebe| are you two talking about the same baby? hey! have you started off thinking of names yet?
rachel| oh yeah! ive come up with a bunch of ideas!|ross| really? me too!
phoebe| me too!|rachel| really?!
phoebe| uh huh! if its a girl, phoebe, and if its a boy, phoebo!|ross| maybe. but it wouldnt hurt to have a backup, you know? uh, rach-rach, what were you thinking? 
rachel| okay! i was thinking if its a girl, how about sandrine? its french.|ross| huh. thats a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
rachel| okay fine, what do you have?|ross| well, ok, its for a boy. well, i know its a little out there, butdarwin.
rachel| wow, oh my god, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.|phoebe| yeah, by sandrine.
ross| youre just saying that 'cause i said no to your name!|rachel| im really, really not.
phoebe| how-how about you each get five vetoes?|ross| all right.
rachel| all right.|ross| that sounds fair.
rachel| yeah! i dont think youre going to need it though. okay, check this out. if its a girl, rain.|ross| veto.
rachel| why?|ross| rain? hi. hi, my name is rain. i have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
phoebe| i know her! i bought homemade soap from her at a dead show!|ross| okay, how about, for a guy, thatcher?
rachel| ross, why do you hate our child?|ross| fine, you go.
rachel| okay, james.|ross| huh.
rachel| but only if its a girl.|ross| oh, veto. how aboutooh, i like ruth! what about ruth?
rachel| oh! im sorry! are we having an 89-year-old? how about dayton?|ross| veto. stewart?
rachel| veto. sawyer?|ross| veto. helen?
rachel| veto.|phoebe| is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
chandler| hey.|monica| boy, do i have a surprise for you!
chandler| sex on the balcony?|monica| no, but someones really not going to get over that idea, are they?
chandler| what is it?|monica| i drew you a bath!
chandler| honey, i dont like baths! could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?|monica| please, could you just try it for me? come on, i used all my best stuff! i-i-i lit some candles. i put on some music. i used bath salts, plus bubble bath! and got you this little plastic navy ship. so its a boy bath!
chandler| well, this does butch it up a bit.|monica| i swear, if you try it, you will love it!
chandler| all right, if i do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?|monica| absolutely.
monica| bet i know how that discussions going to go.|chandler|  all right, this isnt so bad. i like the flower smell! which is okay, because ive got my boat.
monica|  so?|chandler| oh my god.
monica| i told you you were a bath person! hey, when you get out, maybe i can give you a facial!|chandler| im going to need a bigger boat.
ross| i dont think you had an open mind about the name ruth. i mean, come on, little ruthie geller, how-how cute is that?|rachel| oh, oh my god! i can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
dr. long| okay! all your tests look fine. now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?|ross| uh, no. no, were not.
rachel| but you have it right there in that file? you could tell us whether its a boy or a girl? dayton or sandrine? phoebe or phoebo?|dr. long| thats right. but if you dont want to know
ross| no, no, we want to wait, right?|rachel| right. right.
dr. long|  oh, ill be right back. and, uh, i know its really not my place, but please dont name your child phoebo.|rachel|  so, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
ross| what? rach! come on, thats terrible! theyreuhtheyre babies. theyre-theyre all beautiful.|rachel| third one from the left?
ross| yeah, why is it staring at me? i think it knows im talking about it.  dont-dont youwhwhahey!! |rachel| what?! 
ross| youre looking!|rachel| i didnt!
ross| i saw you!|rachel| okay fine, i did. but i didnt see anything, i swear.
ross| shame on you! ugly baby judges you!|rachel| okay, but ross just listen to me
ross| no, no, no, no! dont tell me! i dont want to know!|rachel| but i couldnt even if i wanted to, because i dont know! i swear; i didnt see anything, and i dont want to know! it was just a momentary lapse.
ross| momentary lapse. dont-dont you have any self-control?|rachel|  okay, a couple months late on the lecture, ross.
monica| hello?|chandler| im in the bathroom, can you come in here? i think theres something wrong.
monica| you know what? i-i think ill wait out here. |chandler| im in the bathtub.
monica| oh.  whats wrong?|chandler| i drew my own bath, but i did it wrong! the waters tepid. the salt didnt dissolve and is now lodged places. and the scents i used dont compliment each other. eucalyptus and chamomileoh!
monica| what?|chandler| the bath salts! theyre starting to effervesce! its different.  its interesting.
monica| okay, lets talk about something else.|chandler| yeah! sure, sure. so, what was going on with you today? oh-oh-oh!
monica| well, i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey. he was talking about rules and right and wrong and|chandler| i had the exact same conversation.
monica| you did? what was he talking about?|chandler| i dont know! joey hasnt had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in macbeth!
monica|  that was a long night.|chandler| all right, lets break this down. what exactly did he say to you?
monica| okay, he was talking about rules.|chandler| uh-huh.
monica| umm, and looking at people differently.|chandler| he didnt say anything about that to me.
monica| what did he tell you?|chandler| he was asking all these questions about you, me, and london. and, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
monica| okay. so you, me and london. looking at people differently. maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone.|chandler| but what did he mean by rules?
monica| wait a minute! he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in!|chandler| because he was looking at her differently.
monica| and phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!|chandler| my god! he wants to do it with phoebe in london!
phoebe|  you guys?|monica| just a minute!  thats mrs. tribbiani!
chandler| you dont say anything.|monica| why would i say anything? that two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! and they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?
chandler| im not going to let you say anything.|monica| you just stay here! 
chandler| oh, god!|phoebe| oh, hey, monica, i brought back your iron.
monica| oh, you had that? |phoebe| uh-huh.
monica| i thought i lost it. i got a new one, like, a month ago.|phoebe| oh, just as well, i broke this one.
phoebe| what?|monica| nothing.
phoebe| okay.|monica| i mean, i-i, i really shouldnt say. i mean, im really not supposed to.
phoebe| fine.|monica| its a humdinger!
phoebe| then its really too bad that you cant tell me.|monica| somebody likes you!
phoebe|  is it chandler?|monica| no!
phoebe| well, then tell him to stop staring!|monica| its joey!
phoebe| really?! joey?! you dont say.|monica| is it something youd be interested in?
phoebe| i dont know, i dont know, i dont know. you know, i mean, on the one hand, mother may i? but yknow on the other hand no. no, i cant. were friends. no, oh, no. i dont want to risk what we have.|monica| i guess that makes sense. so, you think youre going to talk to him?
phoebe| sure, yeah. i mean, its joey. i dont want him to get hurt. well, i must say, i am on fire! first chandler, now joey!|monica| not chandler, just joey.
phoebe| sure.|rachel| hey.
ross| hey.|rachel| you know what? ive been thinking about it. im really coming around on the name ruth. i think i would actually consider naming our child that.
ross| rach, i-i cant tell you how-how much that means to me! ohh wait a minute. wait a minute. you-you hated the name ruth! why-why would you change your mind? unless, you know were never going to have to use it. you did see the folder. you know its a boy!|rachel| i didnt see anything! i actually changed my mind about the name.
ross| i dont think so! youre just giving me ruth so youll get to name it when its a boy, and thats when youll swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia.|rachel| i wouldsequoia?
ross| veto.|rachel| fine.
ross| unless  you anticipated that i would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named ruth! well, im not falling for that! okay? ruth is off the table!|rachel| but ross, you want the name ruth!
ross| not like this!|phoebe| hey.

joey| what am i going to do? you know, and i keep, i keep trying to get rid of these feelings, yknow? i stayed up all last night and made a list of everything i dont like about her. you want to hear it?|phoebe| yeah.
joey| she made me switch to light mayo. thats it! thats all i got! and, you know what? it tastes the same and my pants fit better!|phoebe| joey, i just think youre getting worked up over nothing. this is probably just a crush.
joey| you think?|phoebe| absolutely! yknow, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.
joey| yeah, just a crush! thats all this is! its a crush! im joey; i dont get deep feelings.|phoebe| thats right, there you go! crushes happen all the time! i know ive had them for all you guys. well, except for ross and chandler. and im sure youve had them for us.

monica| okay, well, we have to get past this! why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?|chandler| i can do that.

chandler| ya know if you want to, i can just hold them down and you could .|rachel| and my veil was lace, made by blind, belgium nuns.
woman| blind?|rachel| well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.
aunt lisa| ill bet you looked beautiful|rachel| well, i dont know about that, but some said that i looked like a floating angel.
woman|  so, how did you propose?|rachel| oh yeah. thats a great story.
ross| well, um, actually, i-i took her to the planetarium. thats-thats where we had our first date. um, she walked in and i had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower|aunt lisa| oh that is so sweet!
rachel| shhh! i want to hear the rest!|ross| then, fred astaire singing the way you look tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. and i got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words \will you marry me?\
rachel| and the ring, was the size of my fist !|joey| yeah uh, phoebe! look umm, i want to apologize about before, okay? we were being jerks. parkers a nice guy and id like to get to know him.
phoebe| then you better do it now.|joey| why?
phoebe| because im going to kill him|joey| what-what? 
phoebe| you guys were right. hes just too excited abouteverything. i mean im all for living life, but this is the gellers 35th anniversary. okay? lets call a spade a spade this party stinks.|joey| i know im having the worst time. there was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when i finally got up to the plates, i slipped on a giant booger!
phoebe| are you sure it wasnt an oyster?|joey| i guess it couldve been, i didnt really look at it. yknow, i just wiped it on chandlers coat and got the hell out of there.
phoebe| hes just such a great guy im so excited about him.|joey| oh hey, you should be excited about him. theres nothing wrong with him hes a good guy. 
phoebe| you think?|joey| yeah. ya know what i think; i think we were all just being too negative.
phoebe| youre right. youre right, hes just embracing life. we could all stand to be a little more like parker. you know what? i am like him! im a sunny, positive person. |joey| actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
phoebe| whats that now?|joey| nothing
phoebe| oh look its parker! |parker| look! its the bunny hop!
phoebe| oooh i love it!|parker| you do?!
phoebe| are you kidding? people acting like animals to music. come on!|monica| okay its time for the toast! umm now-now, i know that ross usually gives the toast, but this year im going to do it.
monica| no, no its going to be great. really! mom, dad, when i got married, one of the things that made me sure i could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. for that and so many other things i want to say thank you. i know i probably dont say it enough, but i love you.  you people are made of stone! heres to mom and dad! whatever!|mrs. geller| thank you monica that was uh, interesting. wasnt it interesting, jack?
mr. geller|  why dont i remember this dog?|mrs. geller| ross, why dont you give us your toast now?
ross| oh, no, mom, its just monica this year.|mrs. geller| youre not going to say anything? on our 35th wedding anniversary
ross| no, of course, um um, everybody? um, i-i just wanted to sayon behalf of my new bride, rachel , and myself. umm, that ifif in 35 years, were half as happy as you guys are, well count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.|mrs. geller|  oh ross
mr. geller| i just wish nana were alive to hear rosss toast.|parker| my god what a fantastically well lit hallway!
phoebe| can i get you something to drink? like a water and valium? |parker| i must say this apartment, its, its, there are no words
phoebe| oh thank god. |parker| its a haven. a third-floor paradise. a modern-day eden in the midst
phoebe| yeah? i know! i know! uh huh? listen why dont we just um, sit and relax? you know just be with each other. quietly! |parker| that sounds great. 
phoebe| lets try something else, lets play a game.|parker| i love games!
phoebe| shocking! lets play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. |parker| orjenga.
phoebe| but, lets play this one first. and remember whoever talks first loses! |parker| i lose, now jenga.
phoebe| oh my god! oh my god! |parker| is something wrong?
phoebe| wrong? really? you know the word wrong. everything isnt perfect? everything isnt magical? everything isnt a glow with the light of a million fairies? they were just brake lights, parker! |parker| well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!
phoebe| you dont have to put a good spin on everything.|parker| im sorry thats who i am. im a positive person.
phoebe| no! i am a positive person. you are like santa clause on prozac, at disneyland, getting laid! |parker| so what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?
phoebe| much less happy!|parker| fine! well then to quote ross, \id better be going.\ 
phoebe| so long! dont let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! |parker| isnt this the most incredible fight youve ever had in your entire life? 
phoebe| uh huh. |ross| and then, we couldve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
rachel| ross, it just wouldnt have been feasible.|ross| but having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no problem?
rachel| it was really fun being married to you tonight. |ross| yeah! and! and, it was the easiest 400 bucks ive ever made.
rachel| okay ross, can i uh, can i ask you something?|ross| yeah.
rachel| that proposal, at the planetarium|ross| i know, i know it was stupid. 
rachel| are you kidding?! with the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! it wasreally wonderful! did you just make that up? |ross| no, actually i thought about it when, when we were going out. its how i imagined i uh, i would ask you to marry me. 
rachel| well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too. |ross| its a good thing i didnt do it, because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding.  okay, good night
rachel| goodnight|ross| even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messed up? 
rachel| i will think about it. |ross| thats all im askin 
monica| okay thats it. i give up. at mom and dads 40th anniversary, youre the one giving the speech. |ross| yknow i dont understand why they didnt cry. it was a beautiful speech. 
monica| oh, come on. |ross| hey! all that stuff you said about true love, you were right, i mean, we did learn a lot from mom and dad! and that picture of chi-chi with her mischievous grin. and what you said about nana. ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there. and you know what? i think she was. 
ross| hey!|monica| hey!

joey| no. they really like me over there. they want to do a big profile on me, but i said no.|ross| whyd you say no?
joey| remember what happened the last time i did an interview for them? i said i write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. so who knows what i might say this time.|chandler| if only there was something in your head to control the things you say. 
rachel| oh, come on joey! you will totally keep it in check this time, and plus yknow the publicity would be really good for your career! and you deserve that! and if you do the interview you can mention, oh i dont know, gal pal rachel green?|chandler| is that gal pal spelled l-o-s-e-r?
rachel| okay, dont listen to him. please?|joey| fine! all right, ill do it. but hey! you guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if i yknow, start to say something stupid.

rachel| she wants to move in with me and ross to help take care of the baby.|phoebe| for how long?

monica| yes! yes! and i think that the first gift that rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because youre the most important person in this room. and in the world!|mrs. green| well uh, i dont have a gift because i wasnt invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyones attention.

rachel| oh comeof course i know that. i mean of course you never leave a baby alone! i mean who wouldshe wouldnt be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. oh god, okay. yknow what? i think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. so i think umm, im just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. and for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.|woman| its actually a bassinet.

joey| its not just the stuff he paid for, i mean its-its everything. yknow? he read lines with me. he-he went with me on auditions when i was really nervous, and then he consoled me after i didnt get parts that i really wanted. you always believed in me man. even, even when i didnt believe in myself.|chandler| i always knew you were gonna make it. im so proud of you.
joey| thanks. that means a lot to me.|phoebe| mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
joey| |chandler| 
rachel| oh, i have to pee. if i dont come out in five minutes its because ive choked to death on the potpourri stink. |phoebe| when she comes out, you hold her nose, ill blow in her mouth, and the kid will just  right out of her.

rachel|  all right, all right. lets go!|ross| uh, do you wanna go change first? the doctors keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry
rachel| no, im fine.|ross| really? you dont think thats a little inappropriate. 
phoebe| good god man dont anger it.|rachel| ross, it is 100 degrees outside. for the first time in weeks, i am somewhat comfortable.
ross| fine! fine! yknow what? whatever you want. okay? youre the mommy.|rachel| oh uh-uh pal! dont call me mommy! its bad enough you call your own mother that. 
monica| im actually with her on this one.|joey|  \i thought i knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along.\ 
joey| |rachel| ross.
ross| yeah?|rachel| can i ask you something?
ross| uh-huh.|rachel| when carol was pregnant with ben
ross| mmm?|rachel| were you this irritating?
ross| wow!|rachel| excuse me?!
ross| oh nothing. nothing! just uh, youve been a little short with me lately. im not trying to irritate you.|rachel| well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
ross| yknow what? the doctor will be in soon, why dont we not speak until then.|rachel|  seriously, breathe louder ross! thats great!
ross| yknow we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby thats half human and half pure evil!|rachel| hi dr. long, how are you?
ross|  oh, youre nice to her.|rachel| she has the drugs!
dr. long| well do a quick check.|rachel| okay. 
dr. long| so, eight days late huh?|rachel| yeah.
dr. long| you must be a little uncomfortable.|rachel| eh, just a tad.
dr. long| youre about 80 percent effaced, so youre on your way. it still could last a little while longer. if youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along.|ross| do them!!
dr. long| actually, theyre things you can do. just some home remedies, but in my experience ive found that some of them are quite effective.|rachel| well, we are ready to try anything.
dr. long| okay, theres an herbal tea you can drink.|rachel| okay.
dr. long| you can take some caster oil, theres eating spicy foods|rachel| great! we will do all of those.
dr. long| taking a long walk, and then theres the one thats proved most effective: sex.|ross| youve got to be kidding me!
chandler| good job joe! well done! top notch!|joey| you liked it? you really liked it?
chandler| oh-ho-ho, yeah!|joey| which part exactly?
chandler| the whole thing! can we go?|joey| oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
chandler| i love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!|joey| hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? did-did you like that part?
chandler| i was surprised to see a kangaroo in a world war i epic.|joey| you fell asleep!! there was no kangaroo! they didnt take any of my suggestions! thats for coming buddy. ill see you later. 
chandler| dont go! im sorry. im so sorry!  or, call an ambulance.|monica| hey!
ross| hey.|rachel| hi!
monica| what did the doctor say? any news on when the baby will come?|rachel| no. but she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
ross| yeah, we tried them all. we went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.|rachel| well, there is one thing that we havent tried, but someone thinks that,  \that will open up a can of worms.\
monica| well what is it? what is it? if its gonna help bring the baby here, like today. i mean, i think you should do it.|ross| its sex.
monica| do it!|ross| monica!
monica| im just saying its been a really long time for you. i mean, women have needs. do it, get yours!|phoebe| oh i-i dont know about that. no, i think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic. 
monica| all right, lets be practical, if ross isnt willing to do it, hes not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. you can borrow chandlerchandler is good!|ross| monica, what is the matter with you?
monica| nothing. i just want the baby to be born today.|rachel| why? why today?
monica| okay fine! i keep betting phoebe that youre gonna have the baby and i dont want to lose again!|ross| what?! while shes been going through this hell, youve been making money?! youre betting on your friend staying in this misery?! 
rachel| ill take that bet.|ross| what?!
rachel| well, im miserable here! i might as well make some money out it!|ross| can i get some of that action?
monica| wait a minute! now im betting against all three of you?|rachel| oh honey, dont worry. i really do feel like tomorrows the day.
monica| oh, okay!|joey| hey! sleeping beauty!
chandler| where have you been?! i tried to call you! i want to talk to you! i still feel so bad!|joey|  oh no, were you upset? did you lose sleep?
chandler| im so sorry.|joey| uh-huh look, the only reason i can over here was to settle things between us! okay? youve done a lot for me and my career, i wanted to pay you back so i took you to the premiere but you missed it! okay, so how much do i owe you?
chandler| what?!|joey| give me a number, i dont want to owe you anything!
chandler| you dont owe me anything, i dont want you money|joey| ah-ah-ah! were doing this! okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. right, how much were those?
chandler| i dont know, five hundred dollars?|joey| okay, five hundred dollars. what else?

chandler| do you want a calculator?|joey| please! 
chandler| here! |joey| all right, what else?
chandler| well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes|joey| which were still keeping under our hats!
chandler| uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. which after twenty hours of lessons still came out jamaican. |joey| what the hell are you talking about,  \the south will rise again man.\

ross| im sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! my god, im dying.|rachel| oh come on ross, weve done it before well do it again, itll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
ross| this is insane, im not gonna make love to you just so that youll go into labor.|rachel| make love? what are you a girl?
ross| always a great way to get in a mans pants.|rachel| but you will, you will be performing a service. okay? just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, yknow you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
ross| i love when you talk dirty to me.|rachel| oh, i know it. youre right. thats not sexy. ohoh!  oh god!

chandler| that was you?! i thought it was jack!|joey| no! no, that was jack! rachel thinks i asked her to marry  me!
chandler| what?! why does she think that?|joey| because it kinda looked like i did.
chandler| again, what?!|joey| okay well, i was down on one knee with the ring in my hand
chandler| as we all are at some point during the day.|joey| it wasnt my ring! it fell out of rosss jacket! and when i  knelt down to pick it up rachel thought i was proposing!
chandler| ross had a ring?! and he was gonna propose?|joey| i guess.
chandler| and you did it first?! this is gonna kill him! you know how  much he loves to propose!|joey| i know! i know its awful.
chandler| well, what did she say?|joey|  she said yes.
chandler| does ross know?|joey| oh god, what the hell am i going to tell him?
chandler| well maybe you dont have to tell him anything.|joey| oh, i like that. yeah
chandler| if you clear things up with rachel then ross never needs to  find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your  ass!|joey| 
monica| i want a baby.|chandler| honey, weve been over this. i need to be facing the other  way.
monica| come on! come on, if we have sex again itll double our  chances of getting pregnant. do you think that closets still available?|chandler| im so tired.  yeah okay, but no  foreplay.
monica| deal!|ross| dad seriously! yknow you really should see someone about  that!
mr. geller| noted.|ross| i wanna go talk to rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay  alone for a bit?
mr. geller| are you kidding me, i could stay and look at her  forever.|ross| 
phoebe| hey!|rachel| hi.

phoebe| oh my god! he did it?|rachel| welldid you know he was gonna ask me?
phoebe| are you kidding? im like the one who talked him into it. i  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.|rachel| and you really think this is a good idea?
phoebe| i just talked him into it, dont tell me i have to do you too.  the puppet master gets tired people.|rachel| i just dont know! it just doesnt feel right.
phoebe| why?! you two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.|rachel| really?! even ross?
phoebe| especially ross!|joey| 
ross| wow! kind of uh, kind of a full house here. ill guess justill  come back. |phoebe| there he goes, your fiance.

rachel| hey!|nurse| hey! are you ready to try nursing again?
rachel| yeah! hi emma. hey, why do you think she wont take my  breast?|nurse| its all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but dont worry. itll happen.
joey| |rachel| okay sweetie, you can do it. just open up and put it in your  mouth.
joey| dear lord.|rachel| im sorry honey, what were you saying?
joey| oh uh-uh yeah, i think that|rachel| oh look, shes pulling away again! do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?  she looks scared. doesnt she  look scared?
joey| yknow, i dont really know her.|nurse| why dont we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.  
joey|  are you kidding me?!|rachel| its just so frustrating! why doesnt she want my breast?!
joey| i dont know! maybe shes crazy! |phoebe| oh hey! wait up!
ross| hi!|phoebe| congratulations! i didnt want to say anything in front of  joey cause i didnt know if he knew yet.
ross| what, that we had a baby? come on lets give him a little  credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.|phoebe| no! no, that you and rachel are engaged!
ross| what?|phoebe| oh, its a secret. oh goodie! yes! we havent done the secret  thing in a long time.
ross| phoebe, there is no secret. okay? i didnt propose.|phoebe| are you lying? is this like that time you tried to convince us  that you were a doctor?
ross|  i am a doctor! yknow what? im just gonna go and  talk to rachel myself.|phoebe| all right, me too.  should we wake her up?
ross| no! no, come on let her sleep! shes so exhausted.|phoebe| and so engaged. 
ross| what?  oh my god!  she-she thinks were engaged! why? why? why would she think were engaged?!|phoebe| perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? yknow ross  doctors are supposed to be smart.
ross| i didnt give her that ring!|phoebe| really?
ross| no!|phoebe| so whose ring is it?
ross| its mine.|phoebe| is it an engagement ring?
ross| yes!|phoebe| but you didnt give it to her?
ross| no!|phoebe| but you were going to propose?
ross| no!!|phoebe| huh, i might be losing interest in this.
ross| look. look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to  propose to rachel, but all i wanted to do is if she maybekindawanted  ahstartthings up again.|phoebe| oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
ross| look, i didnt want to rush into anything. and it seemed like  she didnt want to either. but i dont, i dont understand how any of this  happened! what? did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that i was going to  propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?|phoebe| no! no, she said you actually proposed to her.
ross| well i didnt! i didnt propose!  did  i? i havent slept in forty hours andit does sound like something i would  do.|chandler| look, we cant stay in here forever.
monica| oh, i still cant believe my dad saw us having sex! he didnt  make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!|chandler| this is okay. were all adults here; theres nothing to be  ashamed of. now, lets put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.  
monica| hi dad! i can still call you that right?|mr. geller| of course. ill always be your dad.
chandler| i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there,  that wasnt for fun.|monica| it wasnt fun?!
chandler|   look, i just dont want you to think that were animals who do it whenever we  want.|mr. geller| oh, i dont think that. before today i never thought of  you two having sex at all. it was a simpler time.
monica| the truth is, dad, were-were trying.|mr. geller| what?
monica| yeah, were trying to get pregnant.|mr. geller| oh my god! this is so exciting! well, get back in there!   ill guard the door!
monica| well, thats okay dad, we-we can wait until later.|mr. geller| whoa-whoa-whoa! i dont think so! arent you  ovulating?
monica| daddy?!|mr. geller| well you gotta get at it princess! when your mother and i  were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. thats  how i got my bad hip.
chandler| thats funny, this conversations how i got the bullet hole  in my head.|mr. geller| this one time i had my knee up on the sink and your  mother, she was
monica| daddy! i dont think we need to hear about the specific  positions you and mom had sex.|mr. geller| youre right, youre right. this is about your positions.  now, what i saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a  child, although it might feel good.
monica| i dont feel good right now.|mr. geller| but pleasure is important,  and it helps if  the woman has an orgasm. you up to the task sailor?
chandler| seriously sir, my brains? all over the wall.|monica| hey.
rachel| hey. i need to tell you something.|monica| well, nows a good time. im on my way to have my ears cut  off.
rachel| joey asked me marry him.|monica| what?

rachel| well, i-i said yes.|monica| what?! are you crazy? you just had rosss baby! its-its so  inappropriate. no, its worse than that. its wrong. its it is bigger than  mine!

ross| rach, i told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes    up.|rachel| yeah well, not anymore i can't. he fired us! what are we gonna do?    we have to find a pediatrician. wait wait, monica said that when you guys were    growing up, you really liked your doctor. what was his name?
ross| dr. gettleman? yeah i know, i don't think that's a good idea. in fact,    i think he's dead.|rachel| argh! why does everything happen to me?!
ross| rach, i promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but i    gotta get up early and i'm not feeling all that well.|rachel| what? what, do you mean you're not feeling well? what do you have?    is it rubella? because don't go near emma, she has not had that shot.
ross| you know? come to think of it, it does feel rubella-like! |rachel|  wiener, wiener!!!
ross|  rachel!!!|rachel| great! now he's gonna know it was me!
phoebe|  hey!|joey| hey!
phoebe| so how is this for our big double date tonight? |joey|  oh my god!

phoebe| of course not! and you're gonna love mary ellen. she's really smart    and cute and funny, and i can't tell you how i know this, but she' not opposed    to threesomes. so tell me some about my guy.|joey| no.
phoebe| come on, give me something. what's his name?|joey| mike.
phoebe| mike? okay! what's his last name?|joey| damnit! is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
phoebe| all right, we'll se you and mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.|joey and phoebe| 
joey| why did i have to say mike? i don't know a mike! why couldn't i have    said...  there's no guy in there!|rachel| it's impossible to find a good doctor. i mean, how do you know the    good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?
monica| excuse me?|chandler| i know what she's talking about.
rachel| we've got to find a new pediatrician. ross was getting sick last night,    and i think emma may have caught it.|monica| why don't you go see dr. gettleman?
rachel| ross said he died.|monica| he didn't die. i saw his daughter last week. said he was fine. her    on the other hand, botched botox.
rachel| oh, great! well, then i'm gonna take emma to see him. i wonder why    ross said that he died.|monica| oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
chandler| he saw a therapist?|monica| yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked    him out.
rachel| why? what was it?|monica| that i was going to eat him.
joey| mike!!!|mike| yeah?
joey| |mike| i gotta tell you, i can't believe i'm doing this with you. although i    did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so i guess i should be open and    taking some risks.
joey| everything is gonna be fine. just follow my lead, okay? all you have    to do is pretend to be mike.|mike| i am mike.
joey| atta boy!|joey| okay, look...
everyone| |phoebe| joey, this is mary ellen jenkins. so, mike, how do you and joey know    each other anyway?
mike| how do i and joey know each other? wow, if i had a nickel for every time    somebody has asked me that.|joey|  from school.
mike| yeah, we met in college.  i mean, high school.|phoebe| wow, you guys go way back then. so what are you up to these days?
mike| well, i'm a lawyer.|joey| mike, 'attorney at law'!
mike| actually, i just gave up my practice.|joey| what? that's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
mike| i always wanted to play piano professionally, and i figured if i don't    do this now, i never will.|phoebe| wow, that's great! i liked that better than the law thing, so...
joey| which is why i waited until now to introduce you to mike.|mary ellen| i thought you thought he was still a lawyer.
joey| no, no, that's not what i meant. let's get you a cocktail.|monica| hey!
chandler| hey!|monica| what are you doing?
chandler| looking for restaurant jobs for you in tulsa.|monica| that's so sweet. find anything?
chandler| slim pickings.|monica| nothing, huh?
chandler| no, 'slim pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. they're looking    for a cook. actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. they're looking for someone    to shovel mesquite.|monica| 'slim pickings'...that is so cheesy.
chandler| 'so cheesy' also has an opening.|monica| honey, that's okay. i actually know this woman, nancy, who's a restaurant    biz head-hunter. maybe she'll know of something.
chandler| can i just say how much i appreciate you coming with me. when we    get to tulsa i'm taking you for a great dinner at 'slim pickings'. 'so cheesy'?    'whole hog'? it's going to be tough to keep kosher in tulsa.|monica|  'i'll take it!'
rachel| hi, my name is rachel green, i have an appointment for emma.|receptionist| dr. gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out    shortly.
dr. gettleman|  i think you just have a cold, it's definitely    not strep.|ross| thanks doctor.
dr. gettleman| would you like a lollypop?|ross| you even have to ask?!  he is alive!
phoebe| you know, it's so surprising that you and joey have known each other    for so long and i've never heard about you.|joey| yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. mike hit my mom with    a car.
mike| no, i didn't.|joey| that's okay mike, i have forgiven you. and now we're friends again everything's    great!
joey| please, we're trying to have a conversation. |mary ellen| wow, you're a lot nicer on 'days of our lives'.
mike| 'days of our lives'! that's why you look so familiar!|phoebe| what?!
mike| what?!|joey| what?!
phoebe| do you not know each other?|joey|  hey, remember the one where i punch you in the face    for not being cool?!
phoebe| mike, let me ask you something. how many sisters does joey have?|mike|  six!
joey| what are you doing? i said seven!  argh!!!|phoebe| joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?
joey| because i forgot about our date, i'm so sorry.|mike| i'm sorry too. and just to be clear, i didn't hit his mother with a car.
phoebe|  you are unbelievable! i spent so much time finding the perfect    girl for you, you know. mary ellen is really smart and cute and loose.|mary ellen| hey!
phoebe| who are you kidding?  you just find some guy off the street    for me? oh god! this is humiliating!|joey| look phoebe i'm so sorry! hey, look, if you don't like this guy i can    find you a better one.  mike!! mike!!
phoebe| i'm out of here |mike| it was nice meeting you!
joey|  you're leaving too?|mary ellen| i'll stay if you can tell me my name.
joey| good night!|chandler| honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to    do.
monica| you're right.  maybe i shouldn't go.|chandler| what?
monica| so nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, javo .    it's just a little outside of tulsa.|chandler| how far outside?
monica| manhattan.|chandler| and you're thinking of taking it?  new job.
monica| i'm gonna miss this hand! okay i know it's a lot to ask, but oh my    god chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.|chandler| what happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
monica| well, if you really think about it, i mean four days is not that long.    i mean, i see you monday before you go to work, and i see you thursday when    you get back, and i always work late on tuesdays, so really if you think about    it, it's really just one day. and well, if we can't make it one day, we've got    real problems my friend.|chandler| i think you should take the job.
monica| really?|chandler| yeah. i know it must be important to you when you start chattering    like a monkey.
monica| that's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!|ross| hey!
monica| how was the pediatrician?|rachel| oh, i really liked him.  yeah, it was really, really,    really good.
ross| you promised you wouldn't say anything.|rachel| i know.  i don't    care!
monica| are you serious? you still see dr. gettleman?|ross| he's a brilliant diagnostician!
chandler| diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?|rachel| ross, seriously! you've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
ross| why? why? i know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay?    he knows my medical history, and every time i go in there, he makes a big deal.    'ah look, it's my favorite patient!'|chandler| does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
ross| hey, i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!|chandler| that was not a security blanket! that was a wall-hanging!
ross| it didn't spend much time on the wall!!!|mike| excuse me, hi. i was hoping i would run into you. can we talk?
phoebe| sure.|mike| i'm sorry, really, i'm so embarrassed. really, i'm a pretty nice guy.    just ask my parole officer...apparently i'm not a funny guy.
phoebe| why did you go along with that?|mike| because i was told i'd get a free dinner, which i didn't. and that i'd    meet a pretty girl. which i did.
phoebe| that's true.  well, is anything you told me about yourself true?|mike| my name in mike, and i do play piano.
phoebe| prove it.|mike| there isn't a piano here.
phoebe| that wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.|mike| 
phoebe| you are really good! i play a little guitar myself.|mike| really?
phoebe| uhuh.|mike| that's great. what kind of music do you play?
phoebe| well, like acoustic folksy stuff. you know? but right now i'm working    on a couple 'iron maiden' covers.|mike| do you think that maybe, sometime, i could...
phoebe| it's okay. go ahead, ask me out.|mike| okay. do you think maybe sometime i could take you out?
joey| |phoebe|  oh, you just caught me off guard! yeah, that would be nice.
joey| look at this. my two best friends!|ross| excuse me, i don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came    in after me.
receptionist| the doctor will be right with you sir.|girl|  mommy, i can't find waldo.
ross| with the circus? he's behind the elephant.|woman| wow, so your child is a big fan of the waldo books too?
ross| yeah, that's how i know. i'm ross by the way.|sally| hi, i'm sally. so, no ring. can i assume you are also a single parent?
ross| i am a single parent.|sally| it's hard isn't it? there's almost no time for a social life. i mean,    where are you gonna meet someone?
ross| well, let's say, i don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's    office.|nurse|  rossy, we're ready for you.
ross| hmm, yeah.  come on ross jr. it's    time to go in.|boy| mommy 
girl| mommy, what's wrong with that man?|ross| hey, i helped you find waldo!

rachel| ah! you know what honey guys are just different, they like things that    we can't understand, you know i once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he    was an archeologist and i was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block    of ice.|monica| eww are you talking about my bother.
rachel| yeah i didn't disguise that very well did i.|joey|  hey
rachel|  hi|joey| listen to this... i went out with this girl last night and half way through    our date i realized i already slept with her.
rachel| so basically you've slept with all the woman in new york and now you're    just going around again.|joey| well that's not even the weird part. i don't think she remembered sleeping    with me.
monica| but you don't remember sleeping with her.|joey| yeah but she should remember sleeping with me i am very memorable, you    guys know.
rachel| what, how do we know, we never slept with you.|joey| and who's fault is that.
monica| what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having    an off night|joey| hey! i never have an off night ok although sometimes when i'm a little    bloated i don't feel very sexy but even then i'm better then most!
monica| honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.|rachel| yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with,    you're made for each other.
joey| interesting. all right i'll go out with her again and try to get past    it  oh salt bloaty!|monica| joey, joey.
joey| what?|monica| you don't think sharks are sexy do you?

ross| hey!|phoebe| hey! mike called were going out again! yay! yay! 
ross| yay!  quick thing,    i went to talk to mike.|phoebe| what? wha-wha-wha-did you do ross!
ross| oh boy you got mad at that part. i went over there to tell him how great    you are but you know me blah, blah, blah, and i ended up telling him that.|phoebe| what!
ross| umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum.|phoebe| what! why?
ross| well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.|phoebe|  if you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend    i swear to lucifer a rabid dog would be feasting on your danglers right now!
ross| well phoebe, i think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about    vicrum, his a kite designer |phoebe| i'm not going along with some lie you made ross, no i'm just gonna    be honest with him.
ross| good yeah just be honest with him.|phoebe| yeah i've nothing to be ashamed of ok so i haven't been in a relationship    that lasted longer then a month. ok i haven't had a real boyfriend you know    if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so i'll just    be alone forever you know alright i'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. i'll    go walking tours with widows and lesbians. oh 
ross| i'll get it|phoebe| ok
mike| |phoebe| uh huh yeah  vicrum just called.
hayley| so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents, a    perfect couple getting divorced, i kinda took it the hardest cause i was the    youngest.|joey| uh huh, sure, yeah. how can you not remember me?
hayley| what?|joey| how could you not remember that we slept together?
hayley| what! when?|joey| i dunno!
hayley| i really, really think i would remember sleeping with you|joey| come on, come on, search your brain all right. it was  here, here, here not there. anything?
hayley| no it's not ringing any bells.|joey| my god woman! how many people do you have to had been with not to remember    any of this?
joey| ooooooooooh, i slept with you! and you obviously remember me hey! i still    got it.  i'll let    myself out.|phoebe| .and i said vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you    know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with rachel.
mike| but rachel i thought she just had a baby with ross|phoebe| yeah well  yeah you know emma's birth certificate might say    geller but her eyes say mookurgee.
mike| that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.|phoebe| i know but he call's and my heart goes to him. you know that bastard    is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
mike| i just think there's somebody better out there for you,  i mean    i'm not saying me but. maybe me.|phoebe| oh.
mike| and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. although i do    smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway i just think i can make you    happy.|phoebe| ok i can't do this.
mike| what's wrong?|phoebe| well there is no vicrum, ross made him up because i never really have    been in a long-term relationship, i've never lived with a guy, and i've never    even celebrated an anniversary so.  you kissed me.
mike| uh huh|phoebe| so you don't think i'm a total freak
mike| no. well look can i think your weird and also cool for telling me the    truth and also wanna kiss you.|phoebe| i guess so, can i. can i think it's cool that you kiss me and also    wanna kiss you again  and umm,    be a little concerned about the magic markers.
mike| definitely|ross|  this is vicrum.
chandler| hi honey i'm home!|monica| hi, how was your flight? 
chandler| oh it was great.|monica| here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because i.  have a little surprise for you.
chandler| well, well, well it must be five in tulsa because it's six o clock    in nyc!|monica| ok 
chandler|  honey why am i watching a bunch of sharks    swimming around.|monica| is this not the good part? do you want me to fast forward to something    a little toothier.
chandler| no i'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.|monica| oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they    did have something called crocodile killers. or does it always have to be sharks?
chandler| does what always have to be sharks.|monica| honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the    tub and thrash.
chandler| what's going on?|monica| sweetie it's ok, i still love you, let me be a part of this.
chandler| let me be a part of this!|monica| i saw what you were doing in tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!
chandler| no they don't|monica| then why were you watching them and giving yourself a treat.
chandler| oh my god! when you came in i switched the channel, i was just watching    regular porn|monica| really?
chandler| yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl american action.|monica| i cannot tell you how happy that makes me! 
chandler| you are an amazing wife.  no really you're amazing    you were actually gonna do this for me, i mean where do you find the strength    and understanding over something like that.|monica| i'm very, very drunk right now.
joey|  see ordinarily i would talk to her, but my    confidence is shaken did i sleep with her? did i not sleep with her? |phoebe| you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude.    your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have    never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless    experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern    into anything serious.
joey| thursday? but that's halloween.|phoebe| so?
joey|  so spooky, that's all.|ross| so, so, is mike coming to dinner?

ross| rach, c'mon, emma is fine. you're turning into an obsessivemother.  okay, you need to stop.|rachel| y'guys ever heard the story about when rosses mom went to  thebeauty salon?
chandler| you mean the lully story?|ross|  huh-huh, they already know it.
phoebe| you guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybeyou  should order.|joey|  no, no, it's okay, i already told the waiter whatthey  want.

phoebe| well, this is, this is, this is not over!  hello?|joey|  well, what is going on with you two?
monica| uch, you see, i'm ovulating.|chandler| oh yeah, that's what she says. but maybe you're notovulating at  all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
monica| yes smokie, that is what it was. i just can't get enough.|chandler|  you not gonna believe this: she lied! she trickedme  into having sex with her.
joey| so? did have sex, right?|chandler| what's the matter with me? why i'm such a girl?

chandler|  hello?|monica|  i love my new job!
chandler| honey, you're screaming.|monica| you bet your ass i am! i just had the best first day ever! the  kitchen: twice as big as allessandro's.
chandler|  oh, that's great.|monica| yeah, a-a-and clean. not just health department clean... monica  clean.
chandler|  awesome.|monica| oh, and the people are so nice. there's this one guy, geoffrey, he's  the maitre d., chandler, you will love him. he is without a doubt, the funniest  guy i have ever met. 
mike| this is nice.|phoebe| i know! 
mike| you need both hands for that?|phoebe| yeah, i kinda do. 
joey| |phoebe| i'm sorry... i'm sorry. it's obviously way too early for us to be...  having that conversation.
mike| is it?|phoebe|  maybe not, is it?
mike| okay, when i got divorced, i didn't think i'd feel this way about  someone for a really long time... then again, i didn't think i'd meet someone  like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... i want you to have this...  ooh, five bucks... i love it when that  happens, you know... think no note's there...|phoebe|  i know mike, why don't you keep digging?
mike| oh, sorry. |phoebe| oh, it's a key. to be honest, i think i'd prefer the five  dollars.
mike| it's to my apartment.|phoebe|  oh wow, ooh! ooh, big step for phoebe and  mike.
mike| yeah, look, and i don't want you to feel like you have to give me your  key just because...|phoebe| oh no, i want to.
mike| oh, thank god. |phoebe| yeah... ooh... wow... even started to think i'd never meet someone  that, you know, i wanted to... do this with. here you go. 
mike| is this cool, huh?|phoebe| it really is.
joey| |rachel| so i don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like  our nanny to start right away, so that emma could get a chance to know her.
prospective nanny| |rachel| that's great, great. so do you have any questions for us?
prospective nanny| not really.|rachel| allright. well thank you so much for coming... 
ross| thank you.|rachel| really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
prospective nanny| oh, you know, wait. i do have one question.  do you guys do random drug testing?|ross| boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
prospective nanny| that's cool. but... but if you do, i'm gonna need three  days notice.|rachel| okidoki!  wow! we're never gonna find a nanny.
ross| oh, come on rach, we will. i promise. we have more interviews  and worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the  uhm... the first one we met with.|rachel|  what, the blonde with no bra?
ross| she was blonde?  just a sec.!  okay, okay. this one's name is sandy. she's got a degree in early childhood  education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.|rachel| okay... 
sandy|  hi... i'm sandy.|ross| and she's a little mannish...
phoebe|  oh my god! david!|david| hi! i-i-is this a bad time?
phoebe|  no! it's a great time, come in...! wow, hi... oh my gosh!  what are you doing here? are you back from minsk?|david| well, just for a couple of days, uhm... i'm here to explain to the  people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their  money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.
phoebe| who cares, it got you here.|david| well, it got me to new york anyway, and then i got on a cab at the  airport, and the guy said where to? and i just... gave him your address i...  i... i didn't even think about it.
phoebe| wow. where is your luggage? |david| damn it!
phoebe| a-allright, well... i'll call the cab company.|david| wa... wa... wait! we can... call them later. can you just... just  stand there f-f-for a moment? boy! there's an old russian expression, uhm... it  goes: schto ya ztez vigul... ui! roughly translated that means uhm... this thing  that i'm looking at: wow!
phoebe| thank you! god, no! you should see me when... oh actually, no, i look  pretty good.|david| are... are you kidding? you know, when you don't see someone for a  long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking  about: come on, don't be crazy. nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are.  
phoebe| no...|phoebe| i'm... i'm just... i'm the worst person ever. how can i not tell  david that i'm seeing mike?
monica| maybe he didn't give you a chance.|phoebe| he said: are you seeing someone? and i said no...
monica| oh, well... that had been your window.|phoebe| yeah! i mean, i don't know. i was just , i was looking, i was looking  in his eyes and i was just thinking: oh my god! it's david. david's here. he's  just, he's so irresistible.
monica| really? the scientist guy?|phoebe| really? chandler?
monica| continue...|phoebe| oh.okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then i told him that i would see  him tomorrow night.
monica| phoebe!|phoebe| i know!  evil! and... and... and... i like mike so  much, you know. it's just going really well. oh my god!
monica| wow, isn't it ironic that david would show up on the same day that  you and mike exchange keys?|phoebe|  uhuh... yeah...!, you know. and given my life long  search for irony, you can imagine how happy i am.
monica| what are you gonna do?|phoebe| i mean i guess, i just have to... tell david that nothing can happen  between us. unless i don't... you know, complicated moral situation, no right,  no wrong...
monica| you have to tell david!|phoebe| okay, i knew i should have had this conversation with joey.
chandler| |monica| heeeeeey! 
chandler| hey!|phoebe| hey!
chandler| so... oklahoma is a crazy place. you know, they call it the sooner  state. frankly i'd sooner be in any other state.  and what's with oklahoma having a pan handle?  can all states have stuff like that? hey yeah, i'm from the waistband, wyoming.  but when i was seven, we headed over to the crotch.|monica|  was your cabin pressurised?
chandler|  and don't get me started on the  way that people from tulsa talk.|phoebe| okay. 
chandler| what's with the word y'all? you know, just... two words just...  pushed together... are we all allowed to do that, because if so, i say why stop  there? you know, your new poodle could be your noodle. and fried chicken? could  be fricken.waiter, waiter excuse me, i'll have the fricken?  see,  that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?|monica| no, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. i told  you about that funny guy, geoffrey, right?
chandler| yeah, he came up...|monica| well, he did this bit... you probably had to be there, but it was  liza minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. 
chandler|  were you there?|phoebe| no, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
sandy| i really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with  another person. i mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart... |rachel| sandy, that's exactly what it is...
ross| are you gay? |rachel| ross!
sandy| it's okay. i get that a lot doing what i do. but i am straight. i-i'm  engaged actually.|rachel| oh!
sandy| her name is deliah.|rachel| oh, that's pretty.
ross|  so you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?|sandy| i realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but i really  believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a  child.
ross|  okay.|sandy| like in my last job, i met daniel when he was three weeks old. and i  got to watch him grow into this awesome person... when i left, i said: i'll see  you soon... and he said to me: skdandy... 
ross| yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. |rachel| oh god, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
sandy| oh, oh, i can do it for her, if you want...|rachel| oh, that would be great!  i love him, i  love him, i love him...
ross| oh, come on, rach, he's a guy!|rachel| so wh..? he's smart, he's qualified. give me one good reason we  shouldn't try him out.
ross| because, it's weird!|rachel| why?
ross| what kind of job is that for a man? a nanny? i-it's like if a woman  wanted to be...|rachel|  yes?
ross| king?|sandy| i er... i hope you don't mind. i used some of my home-made lotion on  emma. it's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. it'll dry that rash right up.  plus... it keeps the hands young... 
rachel|   yes! sandy you're hired.|sandy| that's great!  i'm sorry. it's  just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...
rachel| oooh... ***i really can't hear what she says*** come here.|ross| you gotta be at least bi...
chandler| hey!  i need you to set me up for a joke. later, when monica is around, i  need you to ask me about fire trucks.|joey| ooh. i-i don't know chan. i'm not so good with remembering lines.
chandler|  well, thank god your livelihood  doesn't depend on it.|joey| i know, right?  wh... wh... why  are we doing this?
chandler| monica says that her maitre d. is the funniest guy she's ever  met.|joey| seriously? she actually said that?
chandler| yes! am i crazy to be this upset?|joey| nooooo! being funny is your thing!
chandler| yeah!|joey| without that, you just got \lame with women\.
chandler| ye.... |monica| hi! there you are.
joey| |david| wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.
phoebe| oof...|david| in fact, ehm... i going to kiss you now. 
phoebe| oh, wait, wait!|david| yeah, i-i don't, i can't get away with stuff like that. i-i-it sounded  sexy in my head, so i...
phoebe| no, no, it's not that.  uhm... remember  when you asked me if i was seeing someone and i said no? well, uhm... i am. his  ... his name is mike.|david| oh... oh...
phoebe| yeah, i should have told you.|david| no... well, yeah.
phoebe| i'm sorry, i'm sorry.|david| well, i-it's okay. i-i-i understand... well, s... well, are you happy  with this guy?
phoebe| i am happy.|david| damn it! i-i'm sorry. i-i don't mean that. i-i want you to be happy...  but only with me. no, uhm... that's not fair. uh, who cares, leave him!. oh, i  don't mean that. yes i do... i'm sorry uhm, i... i think i should probably  uhm... go...
phoebe| well... but david, just... i just want you to know that... that...  you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things i've ever had to  do.|david| well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a vladnik  carnival either... can we at least hug goodbye?
phoebe| of course, yeah. you know, a kiss on the cheek  wouldn't be totally inappropriate...|david| no... no...
phoebe| i mean... |david| in minsk...
phoebe| yeah?|david| ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the  lips.
phoebe| well, if that's what they do in minsk... |rachel|   hi...
ross|  is everything allright?|rachel| oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. sandy was just... was just telling me  about how he proposed to his fiance and it was just sooo beautiful.
sandy| well, her favourite flower is the camellia. from the poem...|rachel| i can't... i can't hear it again.
sandy| you know, i can't tell it again... |ross| and i'm fine never having heard it...  rach, can i... can i see you for a sec?
rachel| yeah! |ross| do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? huh?  i haven't cried that many times since i moved in.
rachel| look, ross, he's just... sandy is just sensitive, that's all.|ross| 
rachel| what...? too sensitive to take care of our baby?|ross|  these are amazing!
rachel| sandy made madeleines.|ross| this... this is exactly what i'm talking about. what kind of a guy  makes... makes... delicate french cookies, huh? they're not even... butch, manly  cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. 
rachel| well, i... you know, i-i-i don't know what to say... i mean, i never  thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. you know, 'cause i gotta  tell you ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.|ross| hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
rachel| okay, what? what is too sensitive? |phoebe| hmmm... no, no... no, i can't do this. it's bad.
david| but... i-i-it's nice... a-a-and... nice is good. a-a-and good is not  bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.|phoebe| no, no. no.
david| but... ergo...|phoebe| look david, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably  still be together right now, but... you did leave, and i-i'm with mike and i  really care about him...
david| uhm... uhm... goodbye... uh... schto ya ztez vigul... ui... |mike| well... hey, the key works...! 
phoebe|  and you thanks for the face massage. thank you.|ross| did rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
monica| yeah! i think that's great!|ross| oh really? did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and  bakes madeleines?
monica| oh... how are they?|ross| 
joey| hey!|ross| hey...! rachel and i hired a male nanny.
joey|  really...? guys do that...? that's... weird...|ross| thank you!
joey| that's like a woman wanting to be a...|ross| ...a what? a what? what's the end of that sentence?
monica| yes... what is the end of that sentence?|joey| uhm... a penis model.  anyway, hey... did you tell chandler that some guy  from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
monica| yeah, so?|ross| wow!
joey| really? do you not know chandler?|monica| is that why he's acting so weird...? he's jealous...? oh my god, that  is crazy. it's not like i'm attracted to geoffrey...
joey| so what? being funny is chandler's thing... you know, like ross's thing  is... |ross| science...? academia...? being a good father...?
joey| ...no... |monica| i can't believe he's that upset about this...
joey| monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'cause he's  feeling like... |chandler| hey!
joey| heeeyy! hey!|chandler| what are you guys talking about?
ross| uhm... rachel and i hired a male nanny. |chandler| you got a man who's a nanny...? you got a manny...? 
chandler| you know, i don't mind a... male nanny, but i do draw the line at a  male wetnurse. |monica| ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
chandler| if i'd known you guys were coming over, i would have brought more  pizza. |monica| okay, okay... chandler you... you stop it! 
chandler| what is so funny about that? |monica| well, i don't know... i-it's... just the way you say it... i mean,  you're funny... you have that funny thing. you're a funny guy! 
chandler| did you tell her what we talked about? |joey| yeah....
chandler| so those were pity laughs? pity laughs? |monica| honey, listen... you have nothing to worry about with geoffrey.
chandler| oh yeah? is he funnier than me?|monica| well, you're... you're different funny... i mean, you're... you're  more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and  limericks...
chandler| i do limericks... uhm... there once was a man named chandler, whose  wife made him die inside.|monica| honey, you know i think you're hilarious! come on, you know that joke  you told me last week? the one about jerry lewis and the girl with the lazy  eye...?  that slayed me.
ross| hey... i made up that joke and told it to you! |joey| not knowing when to shut up...
ross| yep! that's my thing...|mike| so... how many guys have your key?
phoebe| no, no, no, no, no... it's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it  looks... really. i was just saying goodbye to an old friend.|mike| your lipstick's on his mouth.
david| oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.|phoebe| no, uhm... david and i did use to go out... but years ago, and he  lives in minsk. he's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.

sandy| who's up for puppets?|joey| me! i'm up for puppets!
sandy| well, please welcome... the snufflebumps... who wants to be mr.  wigglemunch and who's gonna be the grumpus?|ross| okay, okay... how exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate  puppets?
sandy| actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their  cerebral development... the whimsical characters are just for us. |joey| i wanna be mr. wigglemunch. 
ross|  oh my god!|sandy| well, i guess we know who's gonna be the grumpus... 
rachel| that was kind of rude!|ross| oh, i'm sorry. please apologise to sandy and the snufflebumps for  me.
rachel| you know, he was just doing his job...|ross| well, you know what... i-i'm sorry i'm the only one who isn't in love  with gary poppins out there... but i just... i can't... i can't go through with  this.
rachel| oh, come on ross...|ross| no! hey, you know what? i'm sorry. i would never force you... to hire  someone you were this uncomfortable with...
rachel|  oh... that's true.|ross| thank you!
rachel| well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to  do it. |sandy|  so you see wigglemunch, that's why it's important  to shaaaaaaare...
joey|  i am learning so much from you.|chandler| well, i'm off to tulsa, so if your maitre d. friend has any funny  oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at http://www.hahanotsomuch.com/.
monica| honey, you can relax. last night at work, geoffrey told this really  sexist joke. after that, not so funny anymore.|chandler| really...? see... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart,  people!
monica| okay, don't miss that flight. you know i love you.|chandler| i love you too.  
joey| allright. see you later!|chandler| see ya! 
joey|  did that guy really make that joke?|monica| naaaa... he still kills me. last night he had me laughing so hard, i  swear... a little pee came out.
ross| here goes...|rachel| i can't watch. it's like firing elmo. 
ross| sandy... hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. i'm afraid it's not  working out.|sandy|  oh...
ross| yeah, uhm... i mean, rachel and i, think you are great... with emma...  uhm... we just feel...|rachel|  you! you feel!
ross| i... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. i'm sorry.  we're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...|sandy| oh, no, no, no... that's okay. i got a lot of offers from other  families. i just picked you guys because... i liked you the best.
rachel|  oh, damn you geller!|ross| anyway, uhm...well, i'm glad there's no hard feelings.
sandy| no, none at all. you need to be happy with whoever is in your home...  although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? maybe it's  something i can work on in the future.|ross| no, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my  issue.
sandy| what is it...? |ross| you know, i'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as  sensitive as you.
sandy| that's fair... although, can i ask... why do you think that is?|ross| why... i... i don't know.  uhm... errrr...  maybe... maybe because of my father?
sandy| hmmm... |ross| i mean, uhm... you know when i was growing up he was kind of a tough  guy... you know a-a-and as a kid i wasn't the athlete i am now.
rachel|  huh ha ha!|ross| i play squash...! anyway, uhm... i uhm... i always get the feeling he  thought i was too sensitive.
sandy| that must have been hard.|ross| it was hard... i remember... i was in my bedroom... playing with my  dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he  says... \what are you doing with those things? what's wrong with you, why aren't  you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
sandy| but you are a real boy!|ross| i know i am!  ...and when it's summer, and it's  hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
sandy| it's allright! crying is good. it lets the boo-hoos out. |ross| here come some more...
joey| wow! you blow my mind...|sandy| oh, i gotta go.
joey| aaahh... how much do i owe you?|sandy| twenty bucks.
chandler| yeah. hey! here's an idea. why don't we use our wedding china  today?|monica| no, i think we should save our china for something really  special...like, if the queen of england comes over.
chandler| honey, she keeps cancelling on us...take the hint!|monica| what if something gets broken? they're so expensive! 
chandler| what is the point of having them, if we never use them?|monica| ok..but if something gets broken, and then the queen comes  over...
chandler| i will explain it to her.|monica| oh yeah! like i'm going to let you talk to the queen.
joey| wow the parade is really good this year/man those horses can crap!  |narrator from tv| and next up is a marching band from muskogee, oklahoma.
chandler| muskogee? that's like four hours from tulsa! woo hoo!|narrator from tv| and here's the float with the stars of popular daytime  soap, days of our lives. 
joey| oh my god!!|chandler| aren't you one of the stars of popular daytime soap days of our  lives?
joey| yeah!! i forgot i'm supposed to be there! i can't believe i forgot! i  usually write stuff like this down on my arm!|joey| oh! stupid long sleeves!
chandler| what are you going to do?|joey|  like i was some kind of idiot!
chandler| well, you proved them wrong.|joey| yeah...
rachel| oh emma...this is your first thanksgiving...what are you thankful  for? mommy's boobies?|ross| alot of people are thankful for those!

rachel| oh...me too! erm..i had a baby...|amy| i decorated dad's office.
rachel| oh..yeah? well, unless you pushed a desk of your vagina, not the same  thing.|amy| listen erm, about the hair straightener, honey i really need one. i'm  going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house... oh  my god...is this emmet?
rachel| er..it's emma|amy| it's a girl?
ross| hey amy.|rachel| oh amy, you remember ross.
amy| not really. but, you are much cuter than that geeky guy she used to  date. |ross| that was me. 
amy| no...he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on  her, since like the ninth grade.|ross| still me.
monica| careful. careful.. careful!|chandler| i'll tell you what. for the rest of our lives, i'll be careful,  until told otherwise.
chandler| wait a minute. this isn't the china we picked out...|monica| i know! after you left the store i chose different ones.
chandler| why?|monica| well, no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for  me.
chandler| oh suddenly flowers are feminine?|phoebe| hey everybody! happy thanksgiving!
joey| phoebs! |phoebe| hey what's going on, joe?
joey| listen, i...i...i... need a good lie.|phoebe| oh...ok..how about the whole man walking on the moon thing? y'know?  you can.. you can see the strings people!
joey| no..nonono...i need a good lie to explain why i wasn't at the work  thing today.|phoebe| oo. honey, you stink at lying.
joey| wha? i do not!|phoebe| oh really? let me ask you something. yesterday at the coffeehouse, i  went to the bathroom, and when i came back, my muffin was gone. who took it?
joey| somebody opened the door...to the coffeehouse, and a, raccoon  , came running in and went straight for your muffin i said \hey!  don't eat that! that's phoebe's!\ and he said... he said \joey, you stink at lying\. what am i going to  do?|phoebe| don't worry, don't worry. we'll come up with a good lie. i'll help  you practice it.
joey| oh that'd be great. that'd be great. thank you.|phoebe| sure. what was the work thing?
phoebe| pick up grandma at the airport?|joey| ohhh man! 
rachel| oh she's precious...|amy| do you ever worry she'll get your real nose?
rachel| amy...yes i do, i really do. |amy| hello? yeah! hang on, one second.  can i  take this upstairs?
ross| sure! we don't live there but...|amy| seriously? it's just these rooms? i..thought you were a doctor.
rachel| yeah, no ross has a phd.|amy| ewwww!
rachel| god! she is...unbelievable!|ross| i know! i mean a phd is just as good as an md.
rachel| yeah, oh sure ross yeah! if i have a heart attack at a restaurant, i  want you there with your fossil brush!|amy| stupid thanksgiving!
rachel| what? what? what happened?|amy| my boyfriend cancelled on me. i mean i, i finally find a real  relationship someone that i can spend this day with, and then his wife comes  back into town. i swear, it's, it's, not even worth dating married guys.
ross| don't say that!|amy| i was so looking forward to this. it was going to be such a beautiful  thanksgiving. we were going to have sushi...
rachel| oh amy...don't cry. erm. ross? could i talk to you in private?|ross| sure you wanna go upstairs? or...
rachel| erm look. i was thinking, if it's ok with monica, i would like to  invite amy, to thanksgiving.|ross| you know i think that's a great idea. it'll be like the pilgrims being  in the indian's syphillis.
rachel| look, i know she's a little tough to take...but she has no where else  to go. and she's my sister. alright? and she's emma's aunt? and i'd like them to  bond...|ross| ok...fine. but i don't want them bonding too much. i don't want her  telling emma she needs a nose job.
rachel| well! ross, you know what? she may need one we're just going to have  to make our peace with that.|rachel| hi!!
rachel| hey you guys! this is my sister amy...this is chandler, joey, phoebe  and you know mon!|amy| oh my god! you're on days of our lives!
joey| yeah!|amy| wow! they must put alot of make-up on you.
monica| hi. |amy| yeah, i thi, think so. .
amy| ooo! that's a funny noise!|joey| phoebs! i still need some help here.
phoebe| oh! right ok. erm...ok..so it's not just the lie you tell, but it's  the way you tell it for example, if you look down on the ground when you're  talking, people know you're lying.|joey| oh...
phoebe| you are a  terrific actor!|amy| hey! where's the baby?
rachel| oh we just put her down for a nap.|amy| listen, i was just thinking. you know what would be incredible? if you  guys died!
ross| thank you amy!|amy| no, no, then i would get the baby! i mean you know, it'd be just like a  movie, like at first i wouldn't know what to do with her, then i would rise to  the occasion, and then i get a make-over and then i get married?
amy| now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything, cos you know,  you'd be dead. but, i was thinking about changing her name...i'm just not really  a big fan of emily.|ross| emma.
phoebe| phoe-be!|rachel| honey, i don't know how to tell you this but, erm...but if something  were to happen to ross or myself...erm...you wouldn't get the baby.
amy| well, who would?|ross| well, we haven't officially asked them yet, but, we would want monica  and chandler.
chandler| i can't believe you want us to raise emma!|monica| yeah, oh my god..i'm so moved.
amy| i don't believe this. hold on a second. you guys die...and i don't get  your baby???|rachel| amy, see, we're alot closer to monica and chandler. we see them  everyday, and truthfully, honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.
amy| connected? i mean...to what? she's a lump!|chandler| you know guys, i gotta say this, this means so much to me. that  you'd trust me, with your child...i mean, we all know that monica and i have  been trying to have a baby of our own, and i've had my doubts about my skills as  a father, but...that you two....that you two...
amy| this guy? seriously? |monica| ok...it's time for dinner! erm...everyone, we're using our fancy  china, and erm, it's very expensive...so pleaaase be careful.
ross| whoa.....whoa...... whoa!|monica| ok er...just to be clear, comedy with the plates, will not be  well-received. 
joey| hey!! how come my plate is less fancy than everyone elses? do you not  trust me with the fancy plate?|monica| no!!! honey that's...that's a special plate! see, it's a game!  whoever gets that plate, wins!
amy| y'know, this is such a slap in the face. i mean, i'm your sister, and  you'd give your baby to these....strangers over me.|rachel| monica, is ross' sister.
amy| no....ross' sister was really fat.|monica| that was me.
amy| er...no. she was this really dorky girl in high school, who used to  follow rachel around like a puppy...|rachel| amy!! you've got to stop doing that.
monica| ok...listen er...i know that you're having a little bit of a family  crisis but you don't have to take it out on the plates! in fact i think, that,  everyone, should erm...cut their food like this!  now, see? this way you protect the plates,  and let's face it. you have fun.|amy| ok, how bout this. if you guys die, and the crazy plate lady dies...then  do i get the baby.
chandler| no...if crazy plate lady... if  monica dies...then...i would get emma...right? |rachel| well, actually....
chandler| actually what?|ross| er...it's just that in that case...then erm...emma would go to my  parents.
chandler| what??!|amy| hurts doesn't it? 
joey| er... who has to die for me to get her?|chandler| so, if monica's not around, i'm not good enough to raise emma?
ross| no, that's not what we are saying...|joey| yeah! he's lying he looked down! 
chandler| what...what is wrong with me? am i, am i incompetent? because i  managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!|rachel| honey, you're taking this the wrong way. we think you're going to be  a wonderful parent! it's just that, you're more the...y'know, fun parent.
ross| yeah! and we wanna make sure that emma also has someone like monica,  who's more of a disciplinarian...someone who can be firm, and strict.|monica| that's not how you see me is it?
phoebe| no, you're all about the fun. |chandler| look, i may not know alot about babies, but you really think i'm  not capable?
ross| no...you both are equally capable. it's just that you're strongest,  when you're together.|chandler| ok, so if we both had emma, and i die  she'd  have to give her up.
ross| sure! monica would have to give her up.|joey| i lie better than that right? 
chandler| so...so let me get this straight. so my two friends die, i get  emma, then my wife dies, then emma the one-tiny-ray-of-hope left in my life,  gets taken away from me?|monica| hey...there you are. you disappeared after dinner.
chandler| oh, did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise poorly?|monica| ross and rachel don't know what they're talking about! i mean it's  not like they're so responsible. emma as a product of a bottle of murlo and a  five-year-old condom.
chandler| y'know but they're right. i'm not a strong father-figure and i  never will be. |monica| no....you learn these things. you grow into it.
chandler| yeah, but it's not who i am. everything they said is exactly why i  was worried about having a kid. and it's true! and, look, everybody knows  it.|monica| i don't know it! i want to have a kid with you because i think you're  going to be an amazing dad. at the fun parts and at the hard parts.
chandler| oh yeah, well, can you picture me saying, \go to your room! you're  grounded!\|monica| can you hear me say you're grounded?
chandler| you said that to me last week.|monica| how hard is it? no shoes on the furniture!
joey| argh. the producer from days of our life left me a message on the  machine asking why i wasn't at the parade! they say everybody is very pissed off  at me and they all got to meet santa! |phoebe| it's ok. i thought of the perfect lie for you. it's easy to remember  and it doesn't invite alot of questions. you weren't at the parade, because you  had a family emergency.
joey| oh...i like that! yeah! i wasn't at the parade because i had a family  emergency.|phoebe| ooo...what happened?
joey| er...my sister's raccoon came.....|monica| wha...wait what are you doing?
joey| setting the table.|phoebe| i thought it might be nice to use the fancy china for dessert  too.
monica| oh..how nice! maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding  dress|ross| hey dude, you ok? sorry bout before. 
chandler| no, no that's ok. you're totally right i don't know anything about  disciplining a child. but...you did hurt my feelings...so, i want you to know  that if i die, you don't get joey. |amy| in case you haven't noticed, i'm not talking to you.
amy| you know, this is...this is classic rachel.|rachel| oh yeah...yeah, right. remember in high school, when i died, and  didn't give you my baby? 
amy| this, might be my one chance to have a child, rachel. i mean, you know  that i have been so busy focussing on my career...|amy| erm...i'm a decorator?? 
rachel| you decorate dad's office and now you're a decorator? ok! i went to  the zoo yesterday...now i'm a koala bear!|amy| why can't you ever be supportive? 
rachel| suppor...you wanna talk supportive? you didn't even come and visit me  when i was in the hospital having the baby! |amy| oh yeah? well, you didn't come to see me in the hospital when i was  getting my lips done! 
rachel| i did the first time! |rachel| and...and you know what? you wanna know why i'm not giving emily to  you? 
ross| emma.|rachel| oh! whoose side are you on!/ i'm not giving you emma because there is  no way, you could handle the responsibility of a child.
amy| well, how hard could it be? you do it.|joey| ooooooooohoohooo.......
amy| do i know why you don't want me to have the baby? because you don't want  me to be happy! you have always been jealous of me.|rachel| jealous of what? of your lack of responsibility? your...your  inmaturity? your total disregard for other people's feelings? 
amy| er...to name a few!|amy| y'know, you're just, you've always been like this. you just...you had to  have everything and i couldn't have anything. like in junior high, when you  stole timmy from me...i mean do you even realize how much that hurt me?
rachel| timmy was my boyfriend! and you made out with him!!|amy| oh come on, that was twenty years ago, get over it.
rachel| oh god! i cannot believe...i cannot believe that i invited you here  today! |amy| yeah, y'know what i cannot believe? that my so-called sister, gets a  thirty percent discount from ralph lauren and i still have to pay retail? 
rachel| hahah......ahhahah...it's forty-five!|amy| you...bitch. 
amy| you just think you're so perfect. with your new baby, and your...your  small apartment. |amy| well, let me tell you something. your baby? isn't even that cute. 
ross| too far amy. too far. |rachel| you take that back.
amy| no! |rachel| take it back!
amy| no! what are you going to do? make me?|rachel| hey...man! i work out! 
amy| so do i!|rachel| i do karates.
amy| i do yoga.|rachel| bring it on!
monica| put the plates back in the boxes! put the plates back in the  boxes!|rachel| did you just push me? 
amy| uh yeah! i think i did.|rachel| alright that's it!
monica| forget the bubble wrap! there isn't time! |rachel| crazy crazy crazy crazy! 
phoebe| oh my god! shouldn't we stop this? |joey| what are you? out of your mind? let's toss some jell-o on them!
rachel| ew! ew! gross gross!|chandler| alright! that is it! this is our apartment and you cannot behave  this way. now if you can't act your age, then you shouldn't be here at all. now,  those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out...but  they're very important to monica...and i want you to apologize to her right now.  
amy| i'm sorry.|rachel| mon...i'm so sorry.
chandler| ok...that's better. now i want you to apologize to each other, and  mean it.|ross| dude, well done! you know what? if i die, and rachel dies, and monica  dies, you can totally take care of emma. 
chandler| oh yeah? well, thanks! |ross| so, so, now do i get joey? 
chandler| ok...but you should know, he eats five times a day and shoves  pennies up his nose. |rachel| are you ok mon? 
monica| uh huh. these things happen. i mean it's just a plate, it's not like  somebody died.|phoebe| it's alright...you can mourn.
monica| i'm going to go to joey's and get pies. |joey| actually, not pies, it's just pie. 
monica| i don't care. oh my god, i've lost the will to scold.|rachel| look, amy...i got a little out-of-control over there. erm...and i'm  sorry. you're my sister and erm...if it really means that much to you...
amy| so you're going to give me the baby? |rachel| no, i was going to let you use my ralph lauren discount.
amy| you are not going to regret this! |rachel| she needs changing...
chandler| oh no no! i'll get her. i'm super-confident, totally responsible  and fourth in line to raise emma./ i'll be right there emma! just let me get my  trusty diaper bag here.|chandler| well, what do you know? i guess, i'll be the one who dies  first.
phoebe| hey. does monica know about her broken plates yet? |chandler| nope.
phoebe| broke em all huh?|chandler| yup.
phoebe| you going to tell her?|chandler| nope.
chandler| hey! so, i'm gonna put the plates back. y'know i think you're  right...i don't think we should use these plates again for a long time.|monica| like only if the queen comes?
chandler| maybe not even then!|joey| hey! i did it! i called my producer, i told him i had a family  emergency, he totally bought it. thanks for teaching me how to lie phoebs.
phoebe| no problem. next week, stealing!|monica| bye plates!

chandler| eh, it is always better to lie than to have the complicated  discussion.  except with you!|joey| hey! open the door! whats going on?
monica| hi!|joey| why are you dressed like that?
monica|  because i, erm, well, chandlers gonna be home in a  couple of days, so i thought that i would just, er, practice the art of  seduction.|joey| i thought i heard a mans voice before?
monica| i was just doing chandlers side of the conversation, yknow like  hi, how do i look  really sexy, could i be any more  turned on?|joey| woah, woah, woah. why are there two glasses of wine out?

phoebe| so, what if they do?|rachel| were not here to meet guys. you have a boyfriend. i have ababy and  a ross.
phoebe| yeah, but, um, nothing has to happen. just having fun. you know, not  everything has to go as far as eye contact.|monica| chandler, you have to tell joey that you are not in tulsa.
chandler| dont you think its better for him to think that youre cheating  on me than for him to think that i'm cheating on him?  i heard it!|monica| i dont want him to think that i'm having an affair.
chandler| alright. ive got a plan. ill go down the fire escape|monica| yes. because all good plans start with ill just go down the fire  escape
chandler| hear me out, woman! ill go down the fire escape, then ill wait  for a while. then, when i come back up the stairs, itll just be like i got back  from tulsa. then, joey and i will come in here and see that there is no guy in  here.|monica| arent you afraid that joeys going to figure all this out?   i heard it!

rachel| i dont know. he was cute and he liked me. it was an impulse.|phoebe| but what about ross? what about your moment? dont you want to talk  to ross about it?
rachel| no, no, cos i know exactly how the conversation is going to go. hey  ross, you know, i think that we had a moment before  yeah, that works for me, um, um.|phoebe| yeah, i see what you mean. by the way, nice ross imitation. but your  rachel was not whiney enough.
rachel| hey!|phoebe| better!
rachel| the point is: maybe i should stop waiting around, waiting for moments  with ross. i should just move on with my life.|phoebe| so, really? are you moving on from ross?
rachel| dunno, do i have to decide right now?|phoebe| you kinda just did. that guys gonna call you tonight. ross is going  to pick up the phone. thats a pretty clear message.

mike| what? go back? to the land where time stands still?|phoebe| im so sorry, honey, but, okay. rachel gave this guy her number, and,  erm, she does not want ross to answer the phone, so you have to intercept all of  his calls.
mike| i cant do that.|phoebe|  he says that he cant do that
rachel| oh, give me.  hi, mike! hi, listen,  i know this is a lot to ask, but you know what. if you do this, ah, phoebe will  do anything you want. seriously, im talking dirty stuff.|phoebe| alright, give it here.  hello? i'm sorry  about her, but, she wasnt wrong about the dirty stuff.

mike| hey, buddy!|ross| hi!
mike| can i come back in?|ross| w-why? 
mike| well,  i was just thinking of how muck more we  have to talk about.|ross|  but, you left!
joey| wow, that didnt take long. i thought you said tulsa was a three-hour  flight?|chandler| well, youre forgetting about the time difference.
monica| huh, chandler  youre home!|chandler| thats right. your husbands home, so now the sex can stop.
monica| what are you saying?|chandler| joey said that youre in here with another man!
monica| there's no man in here! how dare you accuse me of that? |joey| alright, alright. then maybe you wont mind if me and my friend takes a  look around then. huh! where you at?
chandler| whats he doing?|monica| i arranged some pillows on the bed to make it look like a guy!
joey| bedrooms clear, although you might need some new pillows.|chandler| alright, well, ill check the guest bedroom.
joey| why do i smell mens cologne?|monica| i think that's you.
joey| oh yeah, i rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.|chandler| nobody here, joe.
joey| i guess not.|monica| i cant believe you thought i was cheating. you owe me an  apology.
joey| youre right, monica. im so sorry.|monica| its an honest mistake. it can happen to anybody. alright, see  ya.
joey| wait, wait, wait a minute. if youve just got back from tulsa, how did  your suitcase beat you here?|chandler| i climb down the fire escape, and you cant put that in the  closet?
mike| so, with the exception of the fermentation process, beer and ale are  basically the same thing. fascinating, isnt it?|ross|  maybe you should look up fascinating.
mike| ill get it  its for you.|ross| i dont understand what just happened here.
joey| whats going on?|chandler| im sorry. i told you that i was in tulsa because i wanted to spend  the night with monica and i didntdidnt knowdidnt think youd  understand.

joey| yeah?|monica| i dont know what to say. we shouldnt have lied to you.
chandler| i feel so bad. is there, is there anything i can do to make it up  to you?|joey| you could go to the game with me, even though i know you said you  couldnt, but then you lied to me, tricked me and gave me a bump on the  head.

monica| you can go.|chandler|  what?
monica| you should go to the game. its okay, i want you to.|chandler| really? are you going to be okay?

rachel| yeah, i can't *wait* to go back to work.|ross| i can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
chandler| i'm sorry i won't be here.|monica| it's just... it's hard enough not seeing you during the week,   but for christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do,   i understand.
chandler| thanks.  i'll see you new year's day.|monica|  you're not gonna be here new year's eve??
chandler| did i not mention that?|monica| no!
chandler| |chandler| all right everybody, i know that it's christmas eve and you'd   rather be with your familys, but there's *no* call  -- by the way, you can all call me   chandler.
wendy| hey!|others| hey.
chandler| hey. where've you been?|wendy| i was, uh, checking out that insurance company's christmas party   on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these   decorations and this huge tree and i just, uh... to hell with   them, we have to work. -- so i stole ther ham. 
chandler|  you hear that? you may not be with your familys,   but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.|claudia| my kid's in a play right now.
chandler| y'know what, i know what will cheer you guys up!  i had a little talk with the   boys in new york, told 'em about all the hard work you've been   doing and that a little christmas bonus may be in order.|nick|  \a donation has been made in your name to   the new york city ballet\.
chandler| well, that's like money in your pocket! - alright look, you want   me to say it? this sucks. being here sucks! this work sucks!|wendy| *now* it feels like christmas.
chandler| i'm sorry. hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with   your familys tonight. i have to go back to an empty hotel room   and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. and then tomorrow   morning, you get to have christmas morning in your own houses,   wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.|nick| you can come to my house!
chandler| haha, no thanks!|wendy| that was a nice pep-talk.
chandler| oh, thanks! i'm... actually thinking about becoming a   motivational speaker.|wendy| so, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?
chandler| typical christmas-y stuff, you know? our holidays are pretty   traditional...|phoebe| so here is a, a very special holiday song that i wrote for some   very important people to me.
rachel| okay, pheebs, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back   closet.|chandler| i can save you time ladies, i'm right here.
phoebe| yeah, chandler why don't you take a walk? this doesn't concern   you.|rachel| we are looking for our christmas presents from monica.
chandler| what? that's terrible!|phoebe| no-no, we do it every year!
chandler| oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.|phoebe| no, yeah, we never find them! she's always best at us, that   wily... minx.
rachel| don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and   then we're gonna go over to joey's and search, ok?|chandler| no not okay, you can't look for monica's presents!
phoebe| oh no, we have to!|chandler| no, you don't have to, and you can't because i, i live here too.
phoebe| well then, you should look with us.|chandler| why?
rachel| chandler, aren't you worried about what to get monica for   christmas?|chandler| no, i have a great idea for a present for her.
phoebe| oh, that's it?  a great idea! oh yeah.|rachel| chandler, that's not enough. i mean what if she gets you a   great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little   presents? and you've just gotten her one great present?   i mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. why would you   do that to her chandler? why? why?
chandler| if i help, we can find 'em faster!|rachel| that's right!
phoebe| ooh ooh, we have a live one!|rachel| oh, it's a macy's bag!
rachel| oh.|phoebe| ooh, who's it for?
rachel|  \dear losers,   do you really think i'd hide presents under the couch?   p.s.: chandler, i knew they'd break you.\|joey| rach, these are for you.
rachel| wiper blades. i don't even have a car.|joey| no, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
chandler| ok, pheebs, your turn.|phoebe| ahh, toilet seat covers! is that what you were doing while i   was getting gas?
joey| uh-huh.|phoebe| you guuuyys.
joey| and for ross, mr. sweet-tooth.|ross| you got me a cola drink?
chandler| and, a lemon lime.|ross| well this, this is too much, i feel like i should get you   another sweater.
chandler| and last but not least.|joey| they're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
ross| ooh, hey ben, what if the holiday armadillo told you all about   the festival of lights?|ben| cool!
ross| yeah!|monica| come on ben.
ross| years and years ago there were these people called the   maccabees...|chandler|  ho, ho, ho! merry christmas!
ben| santa! |chandler| hey! 
ross| what are you doing here, santa?|chandler| well, i'm here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing   here, weird...turtle-man?
ross| i'm the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend. you sent   me here to give ben some presents. remember?|chandler| what?
monica| okay ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and santa,   the armadillo and i have a little talk in the kitchen? there's   a sentence i'd never thought i'd say.|ross|  what are you doing?
chandler| you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a   santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work!|ross| thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
chandler| why?|ross| because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and,   and you're-you're wrecking it.
chandler| but i didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.|ross| i'm sorry chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
chandler| fine, i'll give the suit back.|monica| 
chandler| santa? really?|monica| yeah, is that okay?
chandler| did your dad ever dress up like santa?|monica| no.
chandler| then it's okaaay! |chandler| you know what, everybody? go home. you should be with your   familys. it's bad enough that we're working new year's eve.
chandler| good, god's speed, good people!  you're not gonna go?|wendy| naah... i couldn't leave you alone.
chandler| ah. thanks.|wendy| besides, i can't leave until their christmas party downstairs   clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking   for that ham.
chandler| ah.  chandler bing.|monica| hi honey! we're all here; we just want to wish you a merry   christmas.
others| |phoebe|  ble-blah-blar blargh!
chandler| ahh, merry christmas; i miss you guys!|monica| so is it horrible? is everybody working really hard?
chandler| ah, well no, it's just uh, me and wendy.|monica| wendy? -- that sounds like a girl's name.
chandler| it is. did i... not tell you about her?|monica| umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about new year's eve.   where is everybody else?
chandler| i send them home.|monica| ohh, you are such a good boss! is she pretty?
chandler| uhh, uh...|ross|  answer faster, answer faster!
chandler| i don't know!|ross|  answer better, answer better!
chandler| i don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a   colleague.|monica| what does she do there?
chandler| oh, she's regional vice president; she's... just below me.|monica| she did what?
chandler| be-low me!|joey| ahh, wait, is wendy the runner-up miss oklahoma?
monica| *what*??|chandler| well, she... she didn't win...
monica| alright, well, maybe i should let you and the second prettiest   girl in oklahoma get back to work.|chandler| well, second prettiest that year; i mean, of *all* the girls in   oklahoma, she's probably...
rachel|  oh chandler, stop talking!|chandler| honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
monica| okay.|chandler| i'm serious!
monica| okay!|chandler| merry christmas.
monica| merry christmas.|chandler| merry christmas, you guys!
others| |phoebe|  blah blargah, blar-blab.
chandler|  the wife says \hi!\.|wendy| ah. fun conversation?
chandler| ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just   because you and i are alone, that something is gonna happen.|wendy| huh? really? -- hm, that'd be so terrible? 
chandler| this is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but...   you're getting ham on my only tie.|chandler| whoa-ho, back off, missy! 
wendy|  ...missy?|chandler| i don't know; i'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...    wait a minute... am i sexy in oklahoma?
wendy| you are to me... |chandler|  look, i'm, i'm married!
wendy| so? i'm married. |chandler| i'm *happily* married.
wendy| oh. what's *that* like?|chandler| right. so, i'm sorry...
wendy| seriously? happily married. so that phone call before, that was   ... happy?|chandler| well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know.   she's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case:   right on money! ... you know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and   smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass.   look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery   aside. but, what i have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing   is ever gonna happen between us.
wendy| okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have   is so great, then why are you spending christmas with me?|chandler| i mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
monica| really?|chandler| you kidding? you're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...      whoa! whoa! whoa! what's going on? you and i just made out!   you and i are making out?
monica| well, not anymore.|chandler| but we don't do that.
monica| i know, i just thought it would be fun.|chandler| how drunk are you?
monica| drunk enough that i know i wanna do this. not so drunk that   you should feel guilty about taking advantage.|chandler|  that's the perfect amount!
monica| okay!|monica|  y'know what's weird?
chandler| what?|monica| this doesn't feel weird!
chandler| i know.|monica| you're a really good kisser.
chandler| well, i have kissed over four women.  do you   wanna get under the covers?|monica| hm-hmm!
chandler| okay!|monica| wow! you are really fast!
chandler| it bodes well for me that speed impresses you.|monica| we're gonna see each other naked.
chandler| yep!|monica| do you wanna do it at the same time?
chandler| count of three?|monica| one!
chandler| two!|monica| two!
both| three! |chandler| well i think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively   ruined.
monica| eh, we weren't that close anyway!|chandler| eh! 
chandler| so, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?|monica| well uh, you and i are just goofing around, i thought, why not   just goof around with him.
chandler| y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing   around in the dictionary... well, i have, and the technical   definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and   have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. but   if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at   me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary.   i am *so* bad at this.|monica| i think you're better than you think you are.
chandler| really? okay, so...|monica|  know when to stop.
chandler| y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we're okay?|monica| yeah.  don't do the dance.
chandler| right!|monica| i can't get married until i get something old, something new,   something borrowed, and something blue.
chandler| okay, all right, all right, all right! okay!  okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.|monica| you're so efficient. i love you!
chandler| let's go! |monica| no-no-no, wait! we need something old!
chandler| oh, okay, i have condom in my wallet that i've had since i was   twelve.|monica| that'll work!
chandler| i don't think so.|monica| okay, now we just need something borrowed!
chandler| |monica| that's stealing!
chandler| no, we'll-we'll bring it back! just put it under your dress.|monica| ohh. 
chandler| okay, one thing at a time. |monica| listen umm, i've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask   you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you   work, you work really hard for that.
chandler| ehh.|monica| eh, you work for that.
chandler| look, i thought about it too, and i'm sorry. i think we should   spend all of the money on the wedding.|monica| you do?!
chandler| yeah, i'm putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i   told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if   having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's   what we're gonna do.|monica| oh, you're so sweet.  oh, but wait, what   about our, what about the future and stuff?
chandler| eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two   kids, y'know? we'll pick our favorite and that one will get   to go to college.|monica| you thought about that?
chandler| yeah.|monica| how many kids were we gonna have?
chandler| uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.|monica| what else did you think about?
chandler| well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? like a small place   outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their   bikes and stuff. y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell   on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through   the little kitty door. of course, we'd have an apartment over   the garage where joey could grow old.|monica|  y'know what? i-i don't want a big, fancy wedding.
chandler| sure you do.|monica| no, i want everything that you just said. i want a marriage.
chandler| you sure?|monica| uh-hmm.
chandler| i love you so much.|monica| i love you. 
rachel|  oohh, i   love it!|ross| really? you're not gonna return it?
rachel| oh wow, it's so beautiful...|ross| wow, it really is!
monica| \wendy\ is a fat girl name.|phoebe| aren't we done with that?
monica| okay, fine. let's talk about snow. -- do you think it's snowing   in tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?|chandler| hey!
ross| oh my god...|joey| hey-heeyyy - look at that, it's a christmas miracle!
monica| what are you doing here?|chandler| i wanted to be with you. i missed you so much.
joey| hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?|chandler| monica.
joey| got ya. |chandler| i never want to leave you again!
monica| but i thought if you left, you get fired.|chandler| turns out they can't fire me. because i quit.
monica| what?|ross| what, you, you really quit your job?
chandler| yeah! it's a stupid job, and i could not stand leaving you.   and why should i be the only one who doesn't get to do what   he *really* wants to do?|rachel| what do you really want to do?
chandler|  i have *not* thought this through!|monica| oh my god!
chandler| i know, i, i should have talked to you first about it.|monica| no, i think that this is what you wanna do, i think it's great!
chandler| thanks!|phoebe| chandler, your being here is the best christmas present i could   have ever imagined.
chandler|  ahh...|phoebe| now give me my real gift.
phoebe|  thank you.|chandler| 
ross| oh, hey...|ross|  \a donation has been made in your name   to the new york city ballet.\ -- how did you know?

molly| nice to meet you guys .|joey| yeah, you too.
rachel| oh, wow, molly is just great!|ross| yeah.
chandler| yes, bravo on the hot nanny.|rachel| what? you really think she's hot?
chandler| are you kidding? if i wasn't married she'd be rejecting me    right now.|rachel| and joey?
joey| how do you think she's doing?|rachel| am i the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? ross?
ross| eh, i mean, i mena she's not unattractive but hot? i ....|rachel| thank you! 
chandler| now that rachel's gone?|rachel| so hot i cried myself to sleep last night. 
phoebe| hey mike, what's the capital of peru?|mike| lima.
phoebe| no. it starts with a \v\ and ends with an \x\.    helpfully with a \to\ in the middle.|mike| you know, kinda think of it, the capital of peru is \vtox\.     oh god! oh!
phoebe| what?|mike| ok, i don't want to freak you out or anything, but i think i just    saw a rat in your cupboard.
phoebe|  oh, whew, no, that's bob.|mike| what, is he your pet rat?
phoebe| well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who    i put food out for, you know. kinda like santa. except santa doesn't poop on    the plate of cookies.|mike| you can't keep a rat in your appartment! they're extremely unsanitary,    and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
phoebe| what are those?|mike| i don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. you have    to get rid of it!
phoebe| ok, fine, if it means that much to you i'll get rid of bob.|mike| thank you.
phoebe| so weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat    his crackers. |rachel| hello.
gavin| hello|rachel| gavin, i just wanted to say thank you again for watching emma    yesterday during the presentation. i really owe you an appology.
gavin| for what?|rachel| well, when we first met, you know, i thought you were pompous    and arrogant and obnoxious ...
gavin| is this your first appology?|rachel| no, i just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean    anything. and i-i think you're a really good guy and i'm sorry that i misjudged    you.
heather| good morning! |rachel| hello.  i'm sorry,    obviously heather's ass has something more important to say so i'll just wait    'till it's finished.
gavin| what?|rachel| i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her    out!
gavin| i wasn't checking her out. i'm in fashion, i was looking at her    skirt. or was it pants? i didn't really see what happened below the ass area.|rachel| oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
gavin| why do you even care if i was looking at her? are you jealous?|rachel| oh yeah, i'm jealous. \oh gavin, please, please look at    my ass\.  stop looking at my ass! i mean, i just    think you are totally inappropriate, ok? this is a work environment, she's your    subordinate.
gavin| i thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant tag.|rachel| that is totally different for two reasons. one - i didn't know    that you knew that. and two, i wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had    a deap meaningful relationship.
gavin| huh. what's tag's last name?|rachel| it was ...  oh my god. he didn't have a last    name. it was just \tag\. you know, like cher, or, you know, moses.
gavin| but it was a deap meaningful relationship.|rachel| oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely    right. you are arrogant, you are pompous ... morgan! morgan! tag's last name    was morgan! huh!
gavin| it was jones.|rachel| yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
joey| man, i wish i had a nanny like you.|molly| you mean, when you were a baby.
joey| sure.|monica| would you stop staring at her?
chandler| i wasn't staring. i was leering.|monica| what's the big deal with her? maybe she's attractive in an obvious    kind of way.
ross| yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. you know, when it's right there    in your face. me, i like to have to work to find someone attractive. makes me    feel like i earned it.|chandler| looks like joey is doing allright with her.
monica| yeah. hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let joey    get the girl for once.|molly|  i'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
ross| ok, i'll be home right after work. ok, by emma-wemma-demma, i    love you - wovyou dovyou ...|molly| bye
monica| they've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's    not so good.|molly| i think it's sweet. 
rachel|  hey, listen, joey, about molly, i really prefer if    you didn't go after her.|joey| why not?
rachel| because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn't    want anything to, you know, drive her away.|joey| so, what, you think i'm just gonna sleep with her and never call    her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  yeah, sounds    about right.
ross| come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? just - just    forget about her, ok? just, she's off limits.|joey| oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? now that you told    me i can't have it makes me want her even more!
ross| what are you, a child?|joey| yes!
ross| joey, come on now, for me! please, just-just try to focus your    sexual energy on someone else.|joey| fine. 
monica| |phoebe| hey mikey
mike| hey p|phoebe| what are you doing?
mike| setting rat traps.|phoebe| to kill bob??
mike| no, no, to test his neck strength.|phoebe| no, mike, i don't want to kill him! i thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
mike| ok, ok, i'll throw away the traps.|phoebe| i'll find bob, i'll get him. bob?  oh wait, i think i hear him. oh - oh my god! bob    had babies! bob's a mom!
mike| better think of a new name for him.|phoebe| i don't know, i kinda like bob for a girl.
mike| i don't know, i mean i'm not sure  ...|phoebe| oh my god, we killed bob!
mike| maybe it wasn't bob, maybe it was a mouse.|phoebe| suzie? 
ross| whazzup??|chandler| seriously dude, 3 years ago.
ross| listen, can you do me a favor? i'm gonna be out today. can you    just keep an eye on joey, make sure nothing happens between him and molly?|chandler| you don't trust him?
ross| wh - no. some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier    and asked for her daughter, the \hot nanny\.|chandler| is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference?    because i could get a job any day now.
ross| you do appear right on the cusp of something. come on man, i'm    sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do    this for me?|chandler| allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. because    you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something, more often    than not, he's going to have sex with it.
ross| well we gotta do something, ok? nannies like her don't grow on    trees.  |chandler| picturing that tree?
ross| i am, yes.|chandler| where you going, joe?
joey| for a walk.|chandler| oh. you mind if i join you?
joey| actually, that will be long. you know, i really need to organize    my thoughts.|chandler| your thoughts? plural?
joey| allright, fine, i only have one thought! it's about the hot nanny,    i gotta see her!|chandler| i'm afraid i can't let you do that, joe.
joey| now you're telling me i can't see her?? you guys are killing me!    she's forbidden fruit! it's like ... like she's the princess and i'm the stable    boy ... why are you doing this, huh? did ross tell you not to let me go over    there?|chandler| yes, as a matter of fact he did, so i can't let you go.
joey| huh. interesting. now there are obstacles. hot nanny and me against    the world. this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.|chandler| great novels? 
joey| fine ... mediocre porn|gavin| gavin mitchelle's office.
rachel| rachel green's office!! give me that phone! |gavin| hey mom! no, that's just my secretary. 
rachel| um, excuse me gavin, i have a question i need to ask you.|gavin| mom, i'll call you later. yeah.  yes?
rachel| if you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look    at a mirror?|gavin| thank god you finally said that, i saw you make a note on your    pad three hours ago.  man, i really bug you,    don't i?
rachel| oh, please, i don't care about you enough to bug me. in fact,    from now on, i'm going take the high road. and i'm going be very very nice to    you, you \momma's boy\, starting right now.|monica| hey rach!
rachel| hi!|monica| ready for your birthday lunch?
rachel| yeah i am, i am! oh, but first of all, monica, i would like    to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful    friend gavin mitchelle. |gavin| pleased to meet you.
monica| pleased to meet you. so you're coming to rachel's party tonight?|rachel| oh no no no no no, gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely    with his mother. 
gavin| well i don't mind, i'll cancel. i would never miss my secretary's    birthday. |rachel| why did you invite him?? i can't stand that guy!
monica| you were just being so nice to him!|rachel| i was faking it! can't you tell when i'm being fake?
rachel| hey, mr philips, nice suit!|monica| right there! that was so fake!
rachel| shh!|rachel|  i still can't believe you invited gavin. allright,    he is the last person i want to see.
monica| oh, you're welcome for the party. i'm glad you're having a good    time.|rachel| god, i hope he doesn't show up. of course he's not gonna show    up, the guy hates me.
monica| does he?|rachel| what?
monica| maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. it's    like in first grade when skippy langwild always pushed me on the playground    because he secretly had a crush on me?|rachel| oh, monica, you think skippy liked you? honey, all those buys    had a bet to see if he can knock you over.
molly|  she's out, i'm gonna take her home.|rachel| oh, ok, thank you.  do you see what    all the guys see in her?
monica| wouldn't kick her out of bed. no more vodka for me! |joey| hey rach, so can i sing happy birthday to you now?
rachel| yeah, sure!|joey| oh ... 
monica| hey rach, somebody got you shoes!|rachel| oh, give me! 
phoebe| be careful, be careful! these are my rat babies!|mike| yeah. we have rat babies now.
rachel| ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?|monica| so this is what a stroke feels like.
phoebe| i had to bring them! we killed their mother, they're our responsibility    now. you know, they require constant care. you should know that, rachel, you're    a mother.|rachel| are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
phoebe| no! seven rats! i think we should take them home, we need feed    them.|rachel| whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box    of rats?
phoebe| well i'm sorry rachel, but i'm not like you, ok? not everyone    can afford help. |ross| where the hell are joey and molly? i asked you to watch them.
chandler|  i'm sorry, i got a    little occupied.|ross| we have to stop them before something happens!
chandler|  |joey| so you see, molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. it takes a lot of hard work.
molly| so where did you study?|joey| oh, i didn't go to college.
molly| no, where did you study acting?|joey| molly ... people don't study acting ...
ross| molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?|molly| sure, i'll go check on emma.
ross| thanx.|joey|  will the stable boy never get the princess??
ross| what do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here    on my couch?|joey| no ... the leather sticks to my ass. you know, this isn't fair.    what makes you think that i'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?    huh? can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that i actally like her,    and might want something real?  look, the truth is, i haven't felt this    way about anyone since rachel, ok? i didn't think i could ever love again.
ross and chandler| come on! joe!|joey| ok 
woman| hi, is molly here?|ross| yeah, come on in. molly?
molly|  i'll see you tomorrow.|ross| ok ...  well, uh, joey, i guess    we have no problem.
joey| it's like my favorite fairy tale come true!  the princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!|phoebe| ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and i start changing    the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
mike| hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve    around their rats?|phoebe| well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.
mike| ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. what happens when    they mate and there are hundreds of them?|phoebe| mate? they're all brothers and sisters.
mike| yeah - not such a problem with rats. no, they're more of a \love    the one you're with\ kind of animals.|phoebe| no.     that's math i can't even do! what are we gonna do?
mike| well, i know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let    the box of rats ruin our lives.|phoebe| yeah, ok. i guess you're right. allright, so we should just    give them away. but to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins.    they're bob's favorites. 
mike| it's gonna be ok.|phoebe| you must think i'm crazy.
mike| no, i think you're sweet.|phoebe| good. it's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go.    i guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when i gave birth to    my brother's triplets and i had to give them up.  i haven't    told you about that yet, have i?
monica| hey!|rachel| hi. thanks for the party, honey. should i help you clean up?
monica| no way! you had your party, now i have mine! is everything alright?|rachel| yeah, i just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
monica| well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. that jerk    gavin from your office didn't show up .|rachel| mmm hmm.
gavin| yeah, hey. |monica| oh, we weren't talking about you. no, no way to recover.
rachel| no.|gavin| nice party.
rachel| well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed    up at  ... 9:30?? god! oh, this party was lame ...|monica|  again, you're welcome.
gavin| look, i'll just give you this and go.|rachel| oh, you bought me a present! why?
gavin| well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. there    are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. ok, i ... got you    the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.|rachel| aww. well, ok, well that's very nice. and you wrote a card . \from gavin\
gavin| i really mean it.|rachel|  awww, awww, it's beautiful.
gavin| you don't mind?  well, what do you know,    it fits!|rachel| see, gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. why did you    give me such a hard time?
gavin| i'm not sure.|rachel| well monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for    me.
gavin| i do have feelings for you.|rachel| you do?
gavin| yes, i feel that you are a little annoying.|rachel| see? why, gavin, why? right when i'm about to change my opinion    of you, you go and you ... 
chandler| |phoebe|  hey
chandler|  hi|phoebe| listen, i think i've left something here.
chandler| oh, well someone left this . this is    yours?|phoebe|  no, but i like it. i think i left one of    my rat babies.
chandler| oh, uh, well, i haven't seem it but if i do i'll let you know.|monica| ohmygod! rat baby! rat baby! rat baby! 
ross| yeah! yeah! ok! sure! look! can we...can we talk about what happened    here last night?|chandler| sure! just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you!    do you believe that who ever   did something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...i mean    come on!!
ross| ok you...you really don't know what i am talking about?|chandler| no!
ross| ok! last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from    her office out on your balcony.|chandler| our balcony? seriously? that's so funny because i told monica    we should put lights on our balcony. and she said   \no, no. it's too cold, nobody will go out there.\ and i said \maybe    if we put some light out there they will\
ross| right that's why i came over to talk about. hum...i saw rachel kissing    some guy on your balcony,   even though there were no lights !|chandler| so are you gonna...talk to her?
ross| why...why should i? i mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!|chandler| you know when \that's fine\ sounds true when someone    yells it and spits!
ross| no i'm serious. i mean she wants to date people? fine! i don't care    but...at least she could have told me. you know   i...i've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on emma but if    she wants to go out there kissing guys she   barely knows, then so will i ! very funny! ross is gay! ah! ah!|chandler| no no no. good. so you're moving on? do you have any idea where    you're moving?
ross| i don't know. i mean i have plenty of opportunity. just just now    there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.   and then the other day on the subway a woman \accidentally\ sat on    my hand.|chandler| dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
ross| well, and how about this? there is an anthropologist at school who    totally came on to me during the inter-departmental   potluck dinner.|chandler| why did i get married?!
joey| hey! let me ask you guys something. i have a new headshot taken tomorrow    right and the photographer said she thinks i   should have my eyebrows waxed. is that weird for a guy?|phoebe| well it depends.
joey| on...?|phoebe| on how far along he's in the sex change process!
monica| no i totally disagree. no i think it's fine for a guy to do something    like that. such you an actor. not that you need to,   your eyebrows are...|joey| ok! stop it you guys! stop staring! you're freaking me out!
phoebe| your knuckles are kinda hairy too...|joey| oh man! i have to get those done too?!
phoebe| wow! talking about high maintenance|joey| hey hey! you dye your hair!
phoebe| i'm a woman!|joey| arghhh! double standards!
phoebe| oh before i forget, are you coming to mike's piano bar tonight?|monica| only if i don't have to get up and sing.
phoebe| but everybody sings. it's so much fun! last time this adorable    old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out   and everyone booed him off the stage. so funny.|monica| it's just, i'm not good at singing.
phoebe| oh! what's the matter? are you scared? you're afraid i'm a better    singer? you're afraid i'm gonna beat you at singing?|monica| no no, it's not working on me. wow! i must be growing up!
phoebe| ok fine! please come and support mike. you don't have to sing.|monica| so i don't have to sing and i can just sit there and pass judgments    on others?
phoebe| while drinking...|monica| i'm there!
rachel| hi guys! listen i really need your help. i think i did something    really stupid.|phoebe| well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
rachel| no not that. i kissed gavin last night.|phoebe| oh my god.
monica| you kissed him?|rachel| yeah. it was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
monica| wait wait wait. i was at home the whole time. how did i missed    that?|phoebe| it was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping    paper.
monica| oh yeah...so how did you end up kissing?|rachel| you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and,    oh and he gave me this scarf...
monica| i thought you hated him?|rachel| you know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and    it turns out that line...is a scarf!
monica| so are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?|rachel| i don't know. it's so complicated. i work with this guy, you know,    i have the baby, and i have ross, and i just...i don't   know what to do and i have to be at the office and see gavin in ten minutes.
monica| sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to gavin,    and you definitely should talk to ross|rachel| or...i could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
phoebe| wow! five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss    a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!|salon girl| hi
joey| hey. i'm here for my eyebrow appointment.|salon girl| name?
joey| chandler bing.|salon girl| ok. very good. have a seat right over here mr. bing and sonia    will be right with you.
joey| ok thanks.   . i touched the stuff|sonia| i'll take care of it
joey| thanks. do you get a lot of guys in here?|sonia| oh absolutely.
joey| oh good...|sonia| are you looking to meet somebody?
joey| all right let's just do this.|sonia| we'll get to the wax in a minute. first i want to tweeze some of    the strays, ok? this may sting just a little bit...
joey| please i have an extremely high threshold...holly mother of god!    my face! my face!! i'm all right! i'm all right!   just a little bit of shock that's all but i'll be fine you can go again. i'm    ok    dammit! woman!! how hoooow!|chandler| hey it's the most eligible man in ny. how's the moving on going?
ross| not well. i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand    but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.|chandler| well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. you know i    mean think about it. single white male, divorced three times,   two illegitimate children. the personal ad writes itself....
ross| that's funny...do you think you'll ever work again?|chandler| what are doing? you know i can only dish it out!
ross| i can't believe rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me|chandler| maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just    an impulsive one-time birthday thing
ross| no no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.|chandler| did she go out with him?
ross| no. when he called, i...i threw the message away.|chandler| ah! the high road...
ross| you know what? enough! enough talking! i have to get moving! hey    check out those two blondes over there!   hey come with me!|chandler| are you trying to get everybody divorced?
ross| you don't have to do anything. it will just be easier if it is the    two of us, like college, remember? you...you break the   ice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and i swoop    in with some interesting conversation, so   they'll see that i'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one...|chandler| i thought i had to make the jokes!
ross| don't you have to be at work?|chandler| oh come on! hello! hi! my name is chandler, here's my friend    ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it.    we only need six more people for a human pyramid...swoop!! swoop!!
ross| hum...so...hum...oh hey i noticed you were reading the paper...another    flood in europe? heres a question: \would you...   would you rather drown or be burnt alive?\|blonde girl| sorry...we were just leaving
chandler| we still got it!|rachel| who is it?
gavin| gavin! i brought you some soup.|rachel| why?
gavin| i heard you were sick...|rachel| oh! right! yeah! hold on, i'll be just clean up in here a little    bit! hello gavin
gavin| i missed you at work today. how are you feeling?|rachel| i a not gonna lie to you, i'm pretty sick
gavin| oh! good! because i was having a totally paranoid moment when i    thought you called in sick to avoid me.|rachel| oh no no no
gavin| so i had fun last night|rachel| so did i
gavin| exactly how contagious is this thing you have? i mean is it a cold    for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?|rachel| it's just a cold
gavin| do you have fever? let me see. hum...|rachel| what? what's the matter?
gavin| what's ross doing to you on that picture?|rachel| oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. he thought it would be    funny.
gavin| right. right. ross. so what's the deal with you guys? i don't want    to get in the middle of anything|rachel| oh you're not. you're not gonna get in the middle of anything,    don't worry about ross really, really.    oh! hide! that's ross! hide! hide!
gavin| yeah! but you said not to worry about...|rachel| i lied! and i'm not sick! just stay behind the curtain!
molly| hi!|rachel| oh! molly! you're not ross.
molly| no i'm here to take emma to your mother's, remember?|rachel| right, right, yes!
molly| don't panic!|rachel| what?
molly| there is a man behind your curtain. i have a mace in my purse.|rachel| no! that's ok! that's ok! that's ok! no no no no! this is my business    associate gavin. he's just being silly.   gavin come out from behind that curtain!
gavin| hi! gavin! please to meet you. it was my idea to stand there.|molly| hello! i just go and get emma.
rachel| ok.|gavin| so hum...why did i have to hide?
rachel| i thought it was ross.|gavin| so what if it was? i thought there was nothing going on between    you two...
rachel| there isn't. there is totally isn't.|gavin| you hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming    out of a chute for the first time. i used to be a   rodeo clown.
rachel| all right. look. gavin...i...i guess i felt guilty that you were    here, which i shouldn't. you know ross and i are not in   any relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live    together and plus there is just so much   history...you know it's just...i don't know, i'm sorry, i'm just all over the    place.|gavin| it's ok. i know it's probably not my place but can i give you a    piece of advice?
rachel| yes|gavin| i think you should talk to ross about all this.
rachel| people keep saying that. oh i'm sorry gavin|gavin| don't be. it's just bad timing.
rachel| so seriously...rodeo clown?|gavin| one of the best, ma'am, one of the best...
phoebe| \no time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!\    thank you!|mike| oh she's my girlfriend. that's not just how we do it here. i got    to get a break and when we come back we've got kenneth   singing \i touch myself\...i'm not here to judge!
phoebe| hi hi...oh you have got to sing.|monica| no i told you i can't.
phoebe| but you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.|monica| what have you heard me sing?
phoebe| all the time when you're cooking.|monica| what?
phoebe| yeah you're always singing \yummy yummy yummy, i've got love    in my tummy\|monica| yeah i do rock that one.
phoebe| ok so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?|monica| just a little but...it's just so scary! i don't even know what    i would sing...
mike| well i've got a book around...|monica| \delta dawn\
ross| hi! i could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace|woman| you already hit on me an hour ago
ross| right, so that's a firm \no\. i cannot believe this, i    just keep striking out.|chandler| i don't get it neither, i mean you're obviously desperate, you're    asking women how they want to be killed
ross| this is great. rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the    one she wants and i'm gonna die alone.|chandler| by drowning or...?!
michelle| why would he break up with me?|her friend| i don't know sweetie.
michelle| all i ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back.    i mean, am i so unlovable?|chandler| well...
ross| i know! |mike| all right, that was kenneth with his much too literal rendition of    \i touch myself\. coming up next we've got monica   singing \delta dawn\.
monica| wait wait! i can't sing in front of all these people.|phoebe| just pretend they're not even here! it's ok monica, when that spotlight    hits you it so bright you won't see anyone   anyway.
monica| hi! i'm monica and i'm gonna be singing \delta dawn\   \delta dawn, what's that flower you have on? could it be a faded rose from    days gone by? ...\|phoebe| can you totally see through her shirt ?
mike| like an x-ray. bad day not to wear a bra.|monica| \to take you to his mansion in the sky-y?\
joey| hey, i need your help.|chandler| wow, it seems serious. what seems to be the problem, ashley judd?
joey| look, i'll get new headshot taken, all right, so i want to get my    eyebrows shaped|chandler| i am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
joey| you may be a sissy but i'll still . all    right, it hurts so bad, i could only let her do one   eyebrow and now... they dont match!|chandler| its like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
joey| all right, look, you got to help me out, ok? look, i have the magic    marker, i want you to fill in the skinny one so   i dont look stupid for my pictures.|chandler| ok. first of all, this is green!
joey| what the hell am i supposed to do!|chandler| all right, i will help you out but you have to promise me you    will not tell anyone what i am about to tell you.
joey| what, what.|chandler| ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the    lawn or taking out the garbage, well i earned mine   by plucking the eyebrows of my father and his business partners.
joey| oh my god!|chandler| yeah, well, i guess you dont need my help victor victoria!
joey| ok all right, no, no, no, no, i do, i do, i do, i need your help,    but chandler i dont know if i can take anymore   plucking. it hurts so bad!|chandler| oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my gentle    self-loathing touch.
monica| \take me to the mansion in the sky-y\. i am sorry, the    song is over. did you see me out there?|phoebe| every little bit of you!
monica| i cant believe i did this. i cant believe i'm singing for the    people, and they liked me! hey, did you hear that   one shouting look at those tips! i mean, did i really help you get a lot of    tips?|mike| sure.
phoebe| mon', not that you didnt sound good, but...|monica| good? didnt you hear them...i was great! thank you so much for    making me do this. thats is the best gift ever.
mike| also a good gift? underwear.|michelle| thank you so much for letting me do this. public bathrooms freak    me out, i can't even pee, let alone do   anything else.
ross| but, whats great is that you dont mind talking about it.|michelle| its so amazing i met you the same day that eric broke up with    me, because its like you lose a boyfriend,   you get a boyfriend.
ross| uh-ah!|michelle| no dont worry, this is not some rebound thing. i am totally    over eric.
ross| . good choice ross.|rachel| oh, hey! hi, there you are, ive been looking for you everywhere!
ross| oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here i am.|rachel| listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o clock.    so i was hoping you and i could have a   chance to kind of talk somebody here?
ross| oh, yeah, yeah thats michelle.|rachel| who?
ross| oh, just this woman ive been seeing.|rachel| youve being seeing someone?
ross| yeah, didnt i mention that? yeah, i mean, we havent being going    out for too long, but rather there is this   amazing connection between us. i-i mean, in fact just before you came in she    called me her boyfriend. i thought it was   a little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.|michelle| what are you taking amoxicillin for?
ross| how great is this? you are already comfortable enough to look through    my stuff. oh, i am sorry michelle, thats   my roommate, rachel.|rachel| hi, and i am also emmas mother.
michelle| ah, who is emma?|ross| i told you about my daughter.
michelle| this is your daughter? i can be your new mummy!|chandler| and done!
joey| oh my god! i didnt feel a thing ! hey, are you still looking for    a job because you can tweeze circles around   that sadistic bitch at the saloon|chandler| thanks. you wanna see what it looks like?
joey| yeah, yeah. hey, they totally match! they look great! they look great!    how you doing!|chandler| yeah, yeah, i think it looks pretty good. i was a little worried    i was uncovering a birthmark right about   there, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.
joey| thank you so much.|chandler| no problem.
joey| listen thats a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some    manly make up for it.|chandler| yeah.
joey| comb my eyelashes.|monica| ok, for my next song i think ill sing something a little more    upbeat. all right? oh, how about the pointer   sisters i am so excited. and make it bouncy!
phoebe| oh youll probably take care of that on your hands.|chandler| i am sorry i am late. youll understand when youll see joey.
monica| honey, youre just in time, im about to sing another song!|chandler| really? in front of all this people?
monica| and they love me!|chandler| oh my god!
phoebe| yes, she gives the people what they want.|monica| all right, watch!
monica| \tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll    put all other things aside. give in this   time and show me some affection...\|chandler| are those my wifes nipples?
phoebe| oh? isnt that funny? i didn't see that before, i wouldn't have    let her go up again.|chandler| i gotta stop this.
monica| oh, who cares, they still love me! \i am so excited...\|chandler| you, touching yourself, out!
rachel| wow. she does that a lot!|michelle| ross, you didnt tell me you were a doctor!
rachel| what, what, wait a minute! you havent even told her you were a    doctor, yet? how long have you known her, like   an hour?|michelle| actually about an hour and a half.
ross| i told you it wasnt long, but there is an amazing connection between    us.|michelle| you feel that too? oh, i thought that was just me!
ross| are you kidding?|michelle| hey, do you want to go away this weekend?
ross| well see.|rachel| ok, ross, whats going on here, are we just bringing strange women    back to the apartment now?
ross| i dont know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?|rachel| how do you know about that?
ross| through the magic of sight! i was here, putting our child to sleep...|michelle| emma.
ross| when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing    a guy you know, for what? a week?|rachel| oh, thats what this is all about? did you bring her up here to    get back at me?
michelle| no, actually, see i had to pee, cause i cant use public bathrooms    because the doodie parasites.|ross| ok, michelle, its time to go.
michelle| well, call me!|ross| ok.
michelle| no, wait, you dont have my phone number!|ross| you know, if its meant to be, ill guess it. bye, bye.
rachel| score.|ross| oh, i am sorry, did you not like her, because i was hoping that we    could come to one of your kissing parties on   the balcony.
rachel| oh god, i cant believe youre making such a big deal about this.    it was one kiss, one guy, one time!|ross| oh, really!
rachel| yeah.|ross| oh, really!
rachel| oh yeah.|ross| what about the guy from the bar?
rachel| what? who?|ross| the guy you gave your number to.
rachel| whoa, how do you know about that?|ross| because he called here looking for you. so dont tell me this...this    kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,   ok? youve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. and    you didnt even have the courtesy to tell me.
rachel| why didnt i get that message?|ross| what?
rachel| from the guy in the bar, why didnt i get that message?|ross| because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket. do you...do you    not look there?
rachel| ross?|ross| i never gave it to you.
rachel| why?|ross| i dont know.
rachel| oh god. you know what? who you think you are? who are you to decide    what messages i should or should not get?|ross| who am i?
rachel| yes.|ross| i am the guy whos taking care of our baby while youre out at bars    meeting guys!
rachel| oh my god, i cannot believe this. you know i actually came in here    hoping to have a mature conversation with you   about us! but i cant do that with someone who hides my messages and brings    crazy women back to my apartment!|ross| none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! thats not the    point. ok? the point is you...you are the one   who moved on and didnt tell anyone!
rachel| oh, ross, this is just so messed up! whats wrong with us? you    know when people hear about our situation they   always ask, what, you live together but youre not a couple? and you have a    baby, isnt that weird? and i say no.   you know what, its not, because it works for us! but you know this doesnt    work. in fact this is the opposite of working!|ross| uh, clearly.
rachel| and you know, we said that we would, we would live together as    long as this makes sense. an maybe this, you know,   just doesnt make sense anymore.|ross| yeah, maybe not. so what you wanna do?
joey| hey!|rachel| hi. can emma and i live here for a while?
joey| ha, oh, of course.|rachel| thank you.
joey| your eyebrows look weird.|chandler| jeremiah was a bullfrog. was a good friend of mine, never understood    a single word he said, but i helped him   drink his wine. so you just touch yourself for anything?
joey| morning, roomie!|rachel| hey! you remembered to put clothes    on this morning.
joey| fifth day's a charm.|rachel| oh, joey, it's so great to be back    here. i gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and emma.
joey| hey, it's great having you back. you    know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?|ross| hey, you're not naked! so hey, rach,    when will we expect to see you tonight?
rachel| well, i'll probably be back to pick    her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. but she did actually    fall back to sleep, so...|joey| she's probably exhausted from all    that adorable screaming she did last night.
rachel| bye!|ross| bye! hey, i hope emma isn't making    it too hard on you.
joey| no, hey, it's been great.|ross| yeah?
joey| yeah. and look, i just want you to    know that with rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before    are totally over, okay? and even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk    in on a woman using a breast pump...|ross| yeah, that'll do it.
joey| wow! so, how are you?|ross| i'm, i'm okay. 
joey| really?|ross| sure, i mean, do i wish me and rachel    living together would have worked out? of course. you know, i'm disappointed,    but it's not like it's a divorce.
joey| well, actually it...|ross| no, it's not a divorce, it is not    a divorce! anyway, i think rachel and i need to, you know, get on with our lives,    maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
joey| wow, really?|ross| yeah, sure, why not? in fact, if you    know anyone that would be good for me...
joey| sure, i know lots of girls. |ross| yeah? any names come to mind?
joey| ooh, names?|phoebe| hey.
joey| hey. i was just gonna get something    to eat. you want something?|phoebe| what you got?
phoebe| goodie! thanks. so, how is it living    with rachel again? i mean, apart from the great food.|joey| i'm fine, i'm fine, it's just, it's    just weird what's happening with her and ross. you know, yesterday he asked    me to fix him up with somebody.
phoebe| oh my god, rachel asked me if i knew    anyone for her too.|joey| why are they doing this?
phoebe| i don't know. they're so perfect for    each other; it's crazy.|joey| you know what's crazy? these jars.    what is it, like two bites in here?
phoebe| i just wish they'd realise they should    be together.|joey| i know, i know. and when they moved    back in together, i figured y'know, that's where things were headed.
phoebe| i know. they should be a family. they    should get married and have more children.|joey| yes, and they should name one of their    kids joey. i may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
phoebe| you know what? maybe once they start    dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for    each other.|joey| yeah, because it is slim pickings.    i had this date last night: yuck! but we should probably keep it down; she's    still in the bedroom.
phoebe| so, what are we gonna do? are we just    gonna go ahead and set them up with people?|joey| i know; that just pushes them further    and further apart. 
phoebe| yeah.  oh, i know what we can    do. we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise    how good they are together.|joey| ooh, that's a great plan! 
phoebe| yeah, you know what the best part    of it is? i get to do my \plan-laugh.\ |joey| shhh! not so loud, we don't wanna    wake up, uh...
rachel| hey!|monica| hey!
rachel| you guys aren't doing anything tonight,    are you?|chandler| see, now, why would you assume that?    just because we're married? i will have you know that we are very hip, happening    people. now, if you'll excuse me, i have to get back to reading the obituaries.
rachel| i was just asking 'cause i need someone    to watch emma tonight.|monica| sure, we'll do that. what are you    up to?
rachel| well, phoebe set me up on a date.    |monica| oh my god.
chandler| wow.|rachel| why? what's the big deal?
monica| just figured, 'cause you and ross    are...|rachel| what, slept together a year and a    half ago? yeah, i'm all set.
chandler| well, i think it's great that you're    going on a date, you know? i mean, it sounds healthy. i mean, you have needs.    embrace your womanhood!|monica| you want a job? turn off \oprah,\    and send out a resume!
rachel| so i'll bring her by around seven?    is that okay?|monica| oh, it's perfect.
rachel| oh, you guys are gonna have so much    fun! she's at such a cute age. oh, a couple things. now that she's eating solid    food, she poops around the clock. and watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes    to grab it. and oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she    screams bloody murder, but ah... thanks, you guys. have fun!|phoebe| ooh, joey. 
joey| hey.|phoebe| hey. i'm so excited; i just set up    rachel with the worst guy tonight. 
joey| all right! who is he?|phoebe| well, it's this guy i used to massage.    and by massage, i mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
phoebe| oh, yeah.|joey| she's this really boring woman. she's    a teacher! 
phoebe| a teacher?|joey| yeah, yeah, she's really into history    and foreign movies... and oh, oh, she loves puzzles. huh? come on, who loves    puzzles?
phoebe| well, ross does. what... you're -    you're ruining the plan! joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect    woman! |joey| oh my god, you're right! 
phoebe| yeah.|joey| she even reads for pleasure!
phoebe| how do you even know a woman like    that?|joey| what? i'm not allowed to know smart    women? 
phoebe| joey.|joey| i met her at the library. i went in    to pee.
phoebe| so now what do we do?|joey| well, okay, i'll - i'll just call    her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
phoebe| what if we don't find him somebody    else? we'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell ross, and he goes    to the restaurant and gets stood up!|joey| ooh...i hear that's bad. 
phoebe| ooh, so this is great! rachel's gonna    have a terrible date, ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good    they have it together.|joey| ah, yes, the plan! 
phoebe| it's not santa's plan. no, it's...    |joey| yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
phoebe| no, i think we killed it.|chandler| emma? emma? look at me! well, i think    i'll go downstairs for a while.
chandler| no, no, no, no! no, no, no, no! it's    okay, it's okay. i didn't go. don't cry, it's just a bit! i'm your uncle chandler;    funny is all i have!|monica| okay, just so you know, i'm gonna    be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next    48 hours.
chandler| i don't do that.|chandler| i'll try to stop. wait, did you say    until the sixth?
monica| yeah.|chandler| today is the sixth.
monica| no, it's not.|chandler| yes, it's also 2003.
monica| oh my god. today's the sixth?! i may    be done ovulating! i may have also served some very questionable meat at the    restaurant.|chandler| it's okay. go take the test and see    if we're okay.
monica| okay.|chandler| tough crib.
monica| hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks?    there's only one here.|chandler| i might have checked to see if i was    ovulating a couple times.
monica| chandler!|chandler| i am not working. there's not much    to do around here!
ross| excuse me, is there a woman waiting    at the bar? someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?|waiter| uh, there's a drunk chinese guy.
ross| well, if i'm still here in an hour,    buy him a drink on me.|waiter| can i get you another glass of wine?    
ross| nah, i don't know if i should. i don't    wanna be drunk when i go home alone.|waiter| got stood up, huh?
ross| yeah, it's no big deal. it's just    a blind date.|waiter| are you worried your date came, saw    you, and left?
ross| no! |monica| we're okay. i'm still ovulating.
chandler| oh, good, because as of four o'clock    this afternoon, i am not. |monica| so, let's do this.
chandler| i - i don't think i can.|monica| come on. i know you're not eighteen    anymore, but give it a minute.
chandler| because of emma.|monica| oh my god, emma. oh, sweetie, i forgot    you were here. oh, you're right, we can't do this. we can't leave her alone.
chandler| sorry.|monica| unless... maybe we do it here. i mean,    how much can she even be aware of at this age?
chandler| well, she's aware when we leave the    room. she may notice if we start... canoodling in it.|monica| canoodling?
chandler| well, i can't say \hump\    or \screw\ in front of the b-a-b-y.|monica| i don't know. i mean, i guess having    sex in front of a baby isn't so...
chandler| horrifying? scarring? something people    go to jail for?|monica| i guess you're right.
chandler| you guess i'm right? when we stayed    at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought    a deer was staring through the window.|monica| but what kind of a sick bastard wants    to do it in front of a deer?
rachel| wow, everything looks so good! i think    i'm gonna have the chicken.|rachel| oh, well, that's - that's very sweet.    thank you.
steve| i'm kind of funny looking. |rachel| what?
steve| oh, come on, you're way out of my    league. everybody in here knows it. bet that guy over there's probably saying,    \ooh, why she out with him? he must be rich!\ well, i'm not! |steve| i'm not funny either. so, if you were    thinking, \well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some    laughs\... that ain't gonna happen.
rachel| well, come on, steve; let's not rule    out nervous laughter. hey, now wait a minute. phoebe told me that - that you    owned your own restaurant. that's impressive.|steve| i lost it. to drugs. 
steve| i silk-screen t-shirts now.|rachel| really? what's that like?
steve| it's really fulfilling doing something    you hate for no money. that's right. i have no money, i'm not funny, i live    in a studio apartment with two other guys, and i'm pretty sure i'm infertile.|steve| i do like my hair.
rachel| really? |phoebe| hello?
rachel| phoebe, it's me. i'm going to hunt    you down and kill you!|phoebe| hey, rach!
rachel| this is the worst date ever. how could    you set me up with this creep?|phoebe| you know, you are talking about one    of my dear, dear friends. 
rachel| i don't care! this guy is a nightmare!|phoebe| oh, right, so he gets a little crazy    when he's stoned.
rachel| he's not stoned.|phoebe| did he go out for a cigarette? 
rachel| yeah, four times.|phoebe| my dear, sweet rach.
joey| oh, great, pretty soon they'll be    back together.|phoebe| by the time anyone's figured out what    we've done, we'll be in sunny mexico.  oh, wait, that's the end of a different    plan.
monica| she's asleep. chandler?|monica| what are you doing?
chandler| emma was doing it!|monica| she's asleep.
chandler| ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...|monica| yes, but we have to be fast.
joey| hello?|joey| emma? hey! hi!
joey| how are ya? how are ya? where are    your babysitters, huh? why's the bedroom door closed?|joey| you can't have s-e-x, when you're    taking care of the b-a-b-i-e!
waiter| i've got bad news. the chinese guy    left. |ross| eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant    to be.
waiter| look; you got stood up, who cares?    we're gonna show you a good time. just sit and relax. in fact, let me bring    you a crab cake appetizer on the house.|ross| wow, free crab cakes. well, that's    nice. although i was hoping to have sex tonight.
waiter| ooh... |ross| just the crab cakes.
waiter| just get out of here, okay?|ross| what's - what's going on?
waiter| eh, okay, the waiters have a little    pool going. we have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.|ross| what? you - you're making money off    my misery?
waiter| well, if you stay till 9:20, i am.|ross| this is unbelievable. i - i have never    been so insulted in my life. now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, i'll    be on my way.
monica| well, that was weird. you were loud,    and i was fast.|chandler| i think we may have really done it    this time.
monica| oh, i wish i didn't have to wait to    take a pregnancy test.|chandler| you may wanna get some more of those    too.
chandler| where's emma?|monica| oh my god, where's emma? where's emma?
chandler| don't ask me, i was in there canoodling    you!|monica| okay, okay, i'm sure that rachel came    home early and picked up emma. you go look across the hall, and i'll call her    cell.
chandler| okay. |monica| hey, you better hope that we're pregnant,    because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to rachel.
rachel| no, no, no, i admire a man who can    cry.|steve| really?
rachel| don't touch my coat!|rachel| oh, sorry, it's my phone. hello?
rachel| oh my god, this is the worst date    ever!|monica| hey, did you stop by here?
rachel| no.|monica| oh my god, then...
monica| oh, thank god! emma, there you are!|rachel| what? what do you mean, \there    you are\? where was she?
monica| oh, we were playing \peek-a-boo.\    she just  she loves it when i'm dramatic.|joey| because you two were having sex!
monica| no, we weren't!|joey| don't you lie to me! i could tell    by chandler's hair.  you are so lazy. can't you get on top for    once?
chandler| all right, all right, we were. we    were trying to make a baby. monica's ovulating.|joey| hey! it is unacceptable that you two    would have sex with emma in the next room. i'm gonna have to tell rachel about    this. 
chandler| no, no, no.|monica| no, please don't. please, joey. she    will kill us!
joey| hey, i gotta! unless...|monica| unless what?
joey| unless you name your firstborn child    joey.|chandler| what? why?
joey| hey, i may never have kids, and somebody's    gotta carry on my family name.|chandler| your family name is tribbiani.
joey|  you almost had me.|rachel| well, uh...
steve| look, i think i know the answer to    this question, but... would you like to make love to me?|rachel| really, really not.
steve| eh, it's just as well. doesn't work    anyway.|rachel| all right, well that's good to know.    good night, steve.
ross| hey, what's wrong?|rachel| i just had a rough night.
ross| oh. crab cake?|rachel| eww!
ross| well, what happened?|rachel| oh, well, i...it's kind of weird talking    to you about this, but...
ross| monica told me you had a blind date.|rachel| yeah.
ross| i did, too.|rachel| oh.
ross| but is it technically a date if the    other person doesn't show up?|rachel| oh, oh no. do you think she walked    in, saw you and left?
ross| why does everyone keep saying that?|rachel| well, if it makes you feel any better,    i wish my date hadn't shown up.
ross| that bad?|rachel| well, he makes t-shirts for a living,    and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
ross| female body inspector? what size is    that?|phoebe| now, wait a minute. so, they're gonna    name their first child joey?
joey| uh-huh.|phoebe| how - how do i get them to name the    next one after me?
joey| it's easy, you just walk in on them    having sex.|phoebe| oh, so they owe me like, three phoebes.
phoebe| oh my god! look, it's ross and rachel.    oh, the plan is working.|phoebe| don't, don't do the plan-laugh.
ross| the first date we've had in months,    and they were both such disasters.|rachel| oh. huh. you know, it is weird that phoebe would set me    up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date    that didn't even show.
ross| wait a minute; you don't think it    was intentional? i mean, that's just stupid.|joey| we're geniuses! yeah, look at them,    look at them, they're really bonding.
phoebe| oh, yeah, they're falling in love    all over again.|phoebe| oh, they see us! oh, they, they look    mad. oh, they figured it out. they're coming this way. run!
joey| where?|phoebe| mexico!
joey| can you believe they're still not    here?|ross| i know. a double blind date, and we    both get stood up. what are the chances?
joey| i know, i'm so bummed. can we have    our free crab cakes now?|waiter| what?
joey| we've been stood up.  and    we want our free crab cakes.|waiter| guys, give it a rest. nobody's betting    on you tonight. although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that    guy to cry.
monica| i know...god. i haven't seen my savings take a hit like this    since i was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed oreos. what happened    to all our money?|chandler| i'm not sure what they did, but i'm inclined to blame enron.
monica| i guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more    than we're bringing in.|chandler| maybe i should quit and get a job that pays.
monica| oh, but you're finally doing something that you love! i can't    ask you to give that up. though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was    y'know... finding gold.|chandler| you know what? you know what? i think we're making too big    a deal out of this. ok? so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe    next month we cut back on a few things. and maybe we start eating out of joey's    refrigerator for a change. you're chef... what can you make out of backing soda    and beer?
monica| ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.|chandler| no! we're not borrowing money.
monica| why not?|chandler| because we don't do that. we are bings! and if there's one    thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the    pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
monica| wow! i had no idea you had this much pride.|chandler| that's right! i do! and i'm your man. and i'm going to get    us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
mike| i'm gonna go. |phoebe| why??
mike| i haven't been home in a couple of days and i need to get some    more clothes.|phoebe| oh...you don't have to go, i have something that will fit you.
mike| i put that tube top on as a joke.|phoebe| i want you to stay.
mike| i want to stay too but i've gone as bad as much use out of these    boxers as i can..|phoebe| why don't you turn them inside ou...
mike| done it.  i'll be back in    a couple of hours.|phoebe| i'll miss you.
mike| me too.  you    know what? i just realised something. i don't wanna go home.|phoebe| great! ok...i'll go get the tube top.
mike| no, no! what i mean is, i hate going back to my apartment    now... and partly because i live above a known crack den but... mostly because    when i'm there, it's just, i really miss you. so.. do you want to move in together?|phoebe| wow, mike hannigan...you sure know how to make a girl say \hell    yeah!\
mike| so we're doing it?|phoebe| yeah! let's do it! let's live together!  oh god, we're really going to move in together!
mike| yeah!|phoebe| i've always wanted to live with a guy. \pick up your socks!\    \put down the toilet seat!\ \no! we're not having sex anymore!\    it's gonna be fun!
monica| hey joey!|joey| hey!
monica| listen...i need to know that what i'm about to ask you, will    never get back to chandler.|joey| i'd be lying if i said i haven't thought about it myself. chandler    is my best friend, it would be wrong. good......but wrong.
monica|  ok first of all...it would be great. but    that's not what i'm here to talk to you about. i need to borrow some money.|joey| aww, i don't know monica y'know... erm... lending friends money    is always a mistake.
monica| but chandler lent you money!|joey| and i think he would tell you it was a mistake.
monica| come on...i just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.|joey| oh...how much?
monica| two thousand dollars?|joey| two thousand dollars!? what do you think i am? i soap opera star!?
monica| yeah...|joey| that's right i am! 
rachel| hi you guys!|joey| oo...what's in the bag?
rachel| oh er... well you know emma started crawling? i realised that    this place, is very unsafe for a baby. so i went to the store and got some stuff    to baby-proof the apartment.|joey| oh...baby-proofing... why is this such a big deal now? y'know,    when i was a kid it was like.. \whoops! joey fell down the stairs!\    or er.. \whoops! joey electrocuted himself again!\ huh!
monica| anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this    stuff?|rachel| no. i was just going to do this myself. 
joey| you're gonna do it?|rachel| yeah, why? you don't think a woman can do this?
joey| oh, women can. you can't.|rachel| monica...would you please tell joey that he is a pig?
monica| you're a pig. and you can't do this.|rachel| wha!? what!? come on! i found the hardware store all by myself!
joey| the hardware store is right down the street.|rachel| there is a hardware store right down the street?
phoebe| hey you guys! ok, we've got great news.|mike| phoebe and i are moving in together.
phoebe| i know it's so exciting! you know i've never lived with a guy    before.|monica| well you know it's just like living with a girl. only they don't    steal your makeup. unless they're playing \this is what my sister would    look like\ 
chandler| yeah.... she's not so cute.|mike| i'm gonna go to the bathroom.
phoebe| okay, well you put down the toilet seat.|mike| yes dear.
monica| is that a bit you guys do?|phoebe| uh huh...we're playing you two.
monica| we don't do that! tell her we don't do that!|chandler| yes dear.
ross| i can't believe you guys are moving in together. that's, that's    great! i mean...i'm happy for you guys..|monica| i hear wedding bells.
phoebe| monica slow down! ok? i'm just excited to be living with him.    you know i mean, i don't know, can i see someday being married to mike? sure!    yeah. y'know..i can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress    that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. but do i want that    house in connecticut...you know..near the good schools where mike and i can    send sophie and mike junior.. oh my god i do.|ross| phoebe, i had no idea you were so conventional.
phoebe| i know! i guess i am! oh my god! load up the volvo i want to    be a soccer mom!|mike| you ready to go?
phoebe| yeah! you bet roomy!|monica| don't you mean..groomy?
mike| what are you talking about?|phoebe| oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they    have us picking out china patterns. 
phoebe| china patterns!!!!!|rachel| this is easy...can't do this! 
chandler| hey joe!|joey| hey!
chandler| listen er..i need to ask you a favor but you can't tell monica    anything about it.|joey| i thought you didn't have secrets from monica.
chandler| and that would have made the official party line.     monica and i are having a little financial trouble.|joey| yeah, i know.
chandler| what? what do you mean you know?|joey| err... i just figured it out! you know, i mean you're not working    and the economy is bad.
chandler| oh! right.|joey|  that's the fastest i have ever thought!
chandler| anyway, err... i need to borrow some money.|joey| oh! sure! how much? two thousand dollars?
chandler| yes! two thousand dollars exactly! how do you know that! |joey| err...well i...know how much you used to make and i know how much    your rent is. 
chandler| oh ok.|joey|  i am on fire!
joey| err... kind of.|chandler| i can't believe her! did she tell you we were having money    problems?
joey| oh no no no no no... it wasn't... it wasn't because of your money    problems, it was for something for her.|chandler| what?
joey| something personal.|chandler| what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that    she wouldn't tell me about?
woman| excuse me.|joey| boob job.
monica| i don't want her to get a boob job! that's crazy!|joey| well it's...it's not that crazy okay? making them smaller,    that would be crazy.
mike| well hey, i wanna ask you about monica's little \groomy\    joke.|phoebe| oh! alright. well i think the reason people laugh is becuase    it's a play on the word roomy.
mike| i get the joke. sophisticated as it was. now the thing i wanna    say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. us living together,    you're not expecting a proposal, right?|phoebe| oh no! no no! not at all. we're just moving in right now. see    where it goes.
mike| yeah well, that's the thing. for me it's as far as it can ever    go.|phoebe| what do you mean?
mike| look. phoebe, i-i love you. very much. but i never want to get    married again.|phoebe| oh. wow.
mike| it's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. i kind    of lost faith in the whole idea.|phoebe| was it really that bad?
mike| at one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....|phoebe| ok, well that's bad. but don't you think it might be different    with someone else? perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. except for once    in the ocean.
mike| look it's not about who i would marry. and i was certain the first    time i got married it would last forever. and i was totally wrong!|phoebe| but it's just...
mike| look phoebe, it's not about you. i just never wanna get married    again.|phoebe| oh!
mike| i'm sorry. are you ok with that? cause if not...maybe us moving    in together isn't the best idea.|phoebe| no! i definitely don't wanna get married. no i just wanted to    make sure you didn't want to too. whew! coz you know when we move in and you    start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
mike| trust me, i will never...|phoebe| yeah i get that.
rachel| hi!|monica| so you gave in and decided to call someone?
rachel| yeah, i don't know who i was kidding. i can barely use chopsticks.|handyman| you're all set. 
rachel| oh thank you so much. |handyman| thanks.....
chandler| hey rach! there she is...my perfectly proportioned wife.|rachel| don't look at me i never get his jokes.
monica| thank you?|chandler| oh no..don't thank me. thank you. you know there's not one    thing i would change about you? not one single thing! and definitely not...    two... single things.
monica| ok, you're being wierd. do you want sex or did you do something    bad?|chandler| no no! i just love the way you look, i am warm, for    your form.
monica| ok..you know the old classics you know,you look nice? they're    still ok.|chandler| well yes yes... you look nice can mean that your face looks    nice. i want to compliment your body. i mean..i wouldn't change it. at    all. and more specifically, i wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
monica| okay...|chandler| i mean, you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger    would you? don't answer that.
rachel| just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.|monica| i know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
rachel| i don't know! i mean, what brought that on?|monica| oh my god. we're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting    to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
rachel| no you really think that's what it is?|monica| you heard him! \no bigger!\ \you're perfect!\    \just don't get any bigger!\ oh my god he sounded just like my high    school wrestling coach. you know what? i'm going to have to talk to chandler.
rachel| yeah! if you don't i will! of course your body's gonna change.    your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna    lose bladder control.  god! it's just such a magical time!|phoebe| hi
ross| hey!|phoebe| listen, i wanted to ask you something about marriage.
ross| oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? i mean i can    see for all hanging out but to come to my home!|phoebe| no...i really wanted to know how you feel about it.
ross| why?|phoebe| mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
ross| never?|phoebe| never.
ross| wow, are you still going to move in with him?|phoebe| i want to, but i just want you to tell me that marriage isn't    really that big a deal. you know that i won't, i won't be missing out on anything.    that marriage stinks!
ross| yeah, marriage... stinks! i mean if you wanna see a man gain weight    and a woman stop shaving? get them married.|phoebe| that's not how you really feel is it?
ross| no, i'm sorry. look i don't think that's what you wanna hear right    now but i can't help it. i love marriage.|phoebe| seriously? you divorce-o?
ross| if you have to call me name, i prefer \ross the divorcer\.    it's just cooler. look, i know my marriage isn't exactly work out. but i love    to be that committed to another person. and carol had some good times before    she became a lesbian... and once afterward. i'm sorry.|phoebe| it's ok that's how you feel.
ross| but come on! i mean living together will be great! i mean you    guys have so much fun and you love mike.|phoebe| i do love mike.
ross| yeah see? and you are so excited about moving in together before,    and you know what? you should be. it's a big deal!|phoebe| yeah i guess you're right. yeah thanks. this helped. thanks.
ross| the divorcer, to the rescue!|phoebe| it's not cooler.
ross| yeah i just hurt it.|joey| rach?!  so i can't do anything i like????
chandler| hey rach! ah........ perfection.  wouldn't    change a thing. not a thing.|monica| honey?
chandler| yeah?|monica| about that? erm...i'm going to change.
chandler| but honey you don't have to.|monica| i'm going to get bigger!
chandler| honey i... i love your breasts the way they are!|rachel| argh. fascist
monica| well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it    or not! and you know what? it's not just my breasts. my ass is going to get    bigger too.|chandler| your ass?!?!?
rachel| man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger    too!|chandler| they...do that?
monica| it's kind of a package deal!|chandler| god why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
monica| i thought i was something that we both wanted!|chandler| alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able    to get on more with the big boobs. but the giant ass and the big clown feet?
rachel| oh my god chandler! if you can't handle this, what are you going    to be like in the hospital? with the blood and the screaming and the little    present that's shooting out of her!?|chandler|  what?
rachel| joey! why did you tell chandler that monica was getting a boob    job?|joey| because she is!
monica| joey, chandler knows i borrowed the money.|joey| mmmm hmm! for your boob job!
joey| ok so i'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting    any bigger?|ross| hey! what do you guys think about this. \ross: the divorce-force\.
phoebe| better.|mike| very cool.
ross| hey pheebs, you know i'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me    the other day and i hope i was a little helpful.|phoebe| oh yeah you were helpful! yeah, no, thanks you.
ross| good, good. yeah coz the more i thought about it, the more i realised    i don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.|phoebe| what do you mean?
ross| well, i know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught    up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? i mean can you honestly    picture yourself in a volvo?|phoebe| they are awfully boxy...
ross| i don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. i mean it's so...    normal.|phoebe| uh huh.
ross| hey hey, can i help?|chandler| well! we er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored    a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where    it gets really tricky.
ross| you know sometimes your words... they hurt.|joey| hey uh, where do you guys want this?
rachel| yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy.  i mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these    guys.|phoebe| just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle    room? none at all?
mike| no but... you don't want to get married either right?|phoebe| right. except that i do want to get married.
joey|  couldn't have this conversation down at the truck    huh?|mike| you wanna get married?
phoebe| someday.|chandler| aaaaand....... hernia.
phoebe| i haven't exactly had a normal life and i never really felt    i was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of    the regular stuff.|mike| but if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?
phoebe| because i just didn't know how much i wanted it. and i love    you, and i wanted to live with you.|mike| i want to live with you too! let's do that!
phoebe| but i don't think i can! it was ok to move in when i didn't    know what was gonna happen, but i can't move in knowing that nothing is ever    gonna happen.|mike| can we at least try living together? i mean you might change your    mind about marriage.
phoebe| are you gonna change yours?|mike| no.
phoebe| me neither. i think i need to be with someone who wants what    i want.|mike| but i don't want this to end.
phoebe| i don't want it to end either.|mike| i can't believe this is gonna end. i guess i'll have my stuff    packed up.
phoebe| yeah.|mike| ok... so... goodbye.
rachel| i'm so sorry pheebs.|monica| we're all sorry... 
chandler| ah, look on the bright side, i mean you won't have to live    with this ugly chair! that was here already huh? i love you. |joey| ah hah! i did it! ha ha! alright...  better take all i can carry. who knows when i'll    be able to get in here again!
aired| 3/13/2003   teleplay by: brian buckner & sebastian jones    story by: robert carlock   directed by: gary halvorson   transcribed by: eleonora, pheeboh and vanessa|chandler| hey! ready to go?
ross| oh yeah, let me just finish this.|joey| hey ross, check this out!  yeah, i can't do that!
chandler| what are you doin'?|ross| have you seen this? it's a new alumni website for college! it's    cool! you can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
chandler| great, a faster way to tell people that i'm unemployed and    childless .|ross| it's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing...    remember andrea rich?
chandler| the tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?|ross| uh uh... well, her internet company went under and she lost an    ear in a boating accident... 
chandler| bet she'd sleep with you now... |ross| no... i already e-mailed her.
chandler| let me see what you wrote about yourself: \doctor paleontology,    two kids... \  you split with carol because you have different interests?...    i think you split with carol because you've one very similar interest!|ross| you know what? i'm gonna finish this later, ok? let me just grab    my coat.
joey| hey! |ross| 
chandler| maybe we finish this for him!  \also i cloned a dinosaur in my lab. she's    now my girlfriend. i don't care what society says. it's the best sex i've ever    had\... aaand send!|joey|  no, no, no... what    do... you can't do that to him!
ross|  alright, let's go!|joey| dude! 
ross| i think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball    inside the house!|joey| 
rachel| hey! how was basketball?|joey| oh, it was a lot of fun right up until chandler got a finger in    the eye!
rachel| oh, no! who did that?|joey| chandler... hey... 
rachel| she was just crawling around and she found him, so i just let    her sleep with him. that's all right? isn't it?|joey|  oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed    animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... i know that!
rachel| joey... are you sure? i mean, i know how much you love him!|joey| rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? i do not love hugsy. i like    him a normal amount... 
rachel| all right... oh, emma loves him!|joey| why wouldn't she? he's a wonderful person!
phoebe| hi.|monica| hey phoebe... how you doin'? you feelin' better?
phoebe| breaking up sucks! oh, i really miss mike!|chandler| oh, i'm so sorry!
phoebe| oh god, i tried everything to make myself feel better. i even    tried writing a song about it... but... i can't think of anything that rhymes    with aarrgghh!!  hey monica, i really need your help getting through    this... |chandler| you're not gonna need my help?
phoebe| well no, when i get to the point where... you know... i'm ready    to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike... i'm gonna come to you.|chandler| oh good, 'cause i've already thought of 3... 4! i've just    thought of a fourth 
phoebe| ok. i mean i know i did the right thing. you know, mike never    wants to get married and i shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future...    but... pretty soon i'm gonna miss him so much. i'm gonna wanna see him again    and you have to stop me from doing that.|monica| ok, you got it!
phoebe|  unless... maybe it's too crazy about this...    alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still    can't have fun. you know what? forget what i said.|monica| really? if that's what you want... 
phoebe| that was a test and you just failed.|monica| damn it! rookie mistake!
ross|  i have sex with dinosaurs??|chandler| i believe i read that somewhere!
ross| that only is not funny, it's physically impossible! ok? depending    on the species i'd have to have a six foot long...  it's not funny!!|chandler| i respectfully disagree.
ross| i can't believe you put that on my alumni page!|chandler| who cares? nobody reads those things
ross| you'd better hope not because i just read what you put on your    page today.|chandler| i don't have a page.
ross| oh oh oh! i respectfully disagree!!|joey| look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. 
rachel| : step away from the crib,    i have a weapon!|joey| it's okay, it's okay rach, it's me. put down the scrunchy.
rachel| what are you doing?|joey| well, i heard emma stirring, so i came to make sure she could    reach hugsy.
rachel| oh, oh thanks. alright well, now that i'm up i'm going to go    to the bathroom.|joey|     this isn't over.
monica| alright, wait a second, why would ross tell everyone in your    class that you are as...  \gay as the day is long\?|chandler| because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
monica| but that's clearly a joke. this could easily be true. |chandler| would you get that please? people have been calling to congratulate    me all day.
monica|  hello? no, he's not here. yeah, this is his wife.    yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. i guess i should have known.    yeah, i mean, he just kept making me watch moulin rouge.|chandler| hang up, hang up. and that was a great movie! .
monica| what are you doing?|chandler| oh, you'll see my friend.
ross|  i'm dead?|chandler|  and so young.
ross| posting that i died? that really isn't funny.|chandler| well, how you died was funny.
ross| oh please, hit by a blimp?|chandler| it kills over one americans every year.
ross| unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think i'm dead, my professors,    my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. you're messing with people's feelings    here.|chandler| you wanna talk about people's feelings? you should have heard    how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i wouldn't be able to    go with him to key west!
ross| you've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok    'cause i'm on my way to buy some photoshop software and a stack of gay porn.    that's right! your coming out is about to get real graphic.|phoebe| god, i wish mike were here.
monica| okay if mike were here what would the two of you be doing?|monica| what are you, animals? it's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
phoebe| i gotta call him. just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.|monica| phoebe, that's how it starts. i don't need to eat the cake,    i'll just smell the icing... why don't i just eat a little sliver, or, okay,    just a slice or two. and next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get    wedged in going down the tunnel slide. phoebe, honey, i know this is hard. look,    if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. and if you see him, you're    going to want to get back together with him. i know that's not what you want.     give me your phone.
phoebe| here.|monica| and now your cell.
phoebe| okay |monica| this is your cellphone?
phoebe| yes.|monica| this is your current cellphone?
phoebe| yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.|monica| phoebe, where's your purse?
monica| no, no! give it to me!|phoebe| you can't have it.
monica| give it to me!|phoebe| no 
monica| i'll go in there.|phoebe|  oh yeah.
monica| phoebe come here|monica| haha!
phoebe| damn you monica geller hyphen bing!|joey| hey, look who's here! it's joey, and he brought home a friend.
rachel| joey, emma's right here! you promised not to bring girls home    in the middle of the day anymore.|joey| no, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new hugsy!
rachel| oh that's so great, now emma has two hugsy's.|joey| no, no, emma has one hugsy, the new hugsy, huh? the other hugsy,    i don't know, i guess i'll just take it back.
rachel| oh you know what? when i was a little girl i had a little pink    pony named cotton. oh i loved her so much, i took her everywhere, i would braid    her tail... |joey| make the transfer! 
rachel| should i be concerned that a button fell off the old hugsy and    i can't find it?|joey| oh, no don't worry about that, i swallowed that years ago.
rachel| oh, i don't think she likes the new hugsy.|joey| but he's the same.
rachel| yeah, i think she wants the old one back.|joey| but he's the same.
rachel| joey, come on!|joey| he's the same!
joey|  you're not the same!|monica| haha!
phoebe| you know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after i've buzzed    you into the building.|monica| so phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
phoebe| those are my shoes.|monica| oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
phoebe| monica, i really appreciate you checking in on me, but i'm actually    feeling a lot better. yeah, i just kinda want to be alone right now.|monica| who's that? 
phoebe| i ordered chinese food.|phoebe| what are the chances? 1 billion chinese people and they send    mike!?
monica|  what are you doing here?|mike| phoebe called me.
monica| phoebe!|phoebe| i'm sorry, i broke down... i wanted to see him.
monica| damnit phoebe! how did you even call him?|phoebe| there is a speakerphone on the base unit... 
monica| base unit! think monica! think!|mike| look, if i wanna see phoebe and she wants to see... 
monica|  this doesn't concern you!!|mike| oh! sorry, i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name!
monica| look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting    over each other, that much harder.|phoebe| not if nothing happens. why can't... why can't we just hang    out as friends?
monica| sure! if you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe i'll    join ya. you know, i'm your friend .|phoebe| sit down.
monica| oh wow wow wow!! make room for your friend! |mike|  so how've you been?
monica| i've been pretty good!|mike|  you look really beautiful.
phoebe| thanks, you look good too.|monica| oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. keep it clean!
phoebe| so how's the piano playing going?|mike| actually i've been playing a lot of love songs lately. i've missed    you.
phoebe| i've missed you too.|monica| you know, on the way over here, i saw this drunk guy throw up.    and then a pigeon ate it!
chandler| hey, ross, i just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?|ross| uhu uhu, check this out. 
chandler| huh! so that's what i would look like if i worked out... and    was being serviced by a policeman. you're not actually going to send these out    are ya?|ross| eh..actually no, i don't need to because your little \ross is    dead\ joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. nobody posted anything    on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. nobody    called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that i'm dead.  oh my god!    nobody cares that i'm dead!?
chandler| no, come on, you know that's not true.|ross| what are you talking about? you get sixty responses just for coming    out of the closet! i didn't get one response! and i'm dead!
chandler| well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead    community.|ross| i can't believe this. not even my geology lab partner? and i carried    that guy! 
chandler| alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think    that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? that people are    gonna post condolences on a website? this is not about people not caring that    you're dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.|ross| you're right. there isn't a decent outlet.
chandler| right, i mean, come on, i'm sure that if you had a funeral    or a memorial service, tons of people would come.|ross| exactly!! 
chandler| ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? you're having a memorial service for yourself!?|ross| no! that would be stupid! you're having it for me!
chandler| ross, don't press send, don't press se... !|ross| oh, too late, too late! it's sent... oops sorry and so is the    picture of you and the police man... 
rachel| i'm trying to put emma down for a nap, have you seen hugsy?|joey| original or crappy?
rachel| original.|joey| no, sorry haven't seen him.
rachel| then what's that big lump under your covers?|joey| it's monica, ok?
rachel| that's not monica!|joey| alright!! fine! it's original hugsy! no, now i know that emma    wants him but he's mine and i need him..
rachel|  oh god.|joey| ... she's being unreasonable!
rachel|     it's because it reminds her of her uncle joey!|joey| it does?
rachel| yeah! and she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle    joey so much.|joey| really? she... she loves me?
rachel| oh yeah! but you know what? if you need hugsy, don't worry.    emma will totally understand. i won't... but whatever .|joey| ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, i mean rach, i    mean if if... . if hugsy means that much to emma then... well she can have him.
rachel| oooh... you're sweet, i knew uncle joey would step up.  look emma, look who's baaack!|joey| look forget it forget it... i can't do it.
rachel| are you gonna... you're going to take hugsy away from a little    child?|joey| how do you think i got him in the first place?
monica| alright you two, i'm gonna go to the bathroom. now i don't want    anything going on while i'm gone. here's a few things you can discuss: mucus,    fungus and the idea of me and ross doing it.|mike| i've missed you so much! no, i'm not gonna ask you to get back    together because i know we want different things, but just to be with you one    more night.
phoebe| i know, i want that too, but is that going to make it too hard?|mike| it can't be any harder than this... i mean, if i had known the    last time i saw you would be the last time, i... i would have stopped to memorize    your face, the way you move, everything about you. if i had known the last time    i kissed you would have been the last time... i never would have stopped.
monica|  kiss him, you fool!!|phoebe| what?
monica| didn't you hear that speech? if you don't kiss him then i will!|phoebe| oh, i missed you so much! 
strange man|  i knew you'd be here!|mike| oh, crap!
phoebe| who is this?|mike| my friend manny. i asked him to keep me away from you.
monica| hi, that's what i'm doing for phoebe!|manny| well, you are not doing a very good job!
monica| excuse me?|manny| what's with the kissing?
monica| hey, at least i knew where my guy was.|manny| oh yeah yeah, thank god you were here to oversee all the kissing!
monica| you didn't hear the speech!|manny| i've heard the speech:  \if he knew it was    gonna be the last time he saw her... \
monica| hey, it was very moving! you're just heartless!|manny| you're weak!
monica| you're... weird!|manny| your pants are undone!
monica| oh !|manny|  where did they go?
monica| damn it!|manny| oh we blew it. i blame myself.
monica| and i blame you too.|ross| it's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! i    tell you, when i actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
chandler| there you go! someone came!|ross| ok, ok! i'm gonna go hide! oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!    
monica| hi, glad you could come.|chandler|  please, come in.
tom| hi, you're chandler bing, right? i'm tom gordon, i was in your    class.|chandler| oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
tom| thanks... uh... i'm so sorry about ross, it's... |chandler| at least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps 
ross| who is he?|chandler| some guy, tom gordon.
ross| i don't remember him, but then again i touched so many lives.    |monica| so, did you know ross well?
tom| oh, actually i barely knew him. yeah, i came because i heard chandler's    news. d'you know if he's seeing anyone?|monica|  yes, he is. me.
tom| what? you... you... oh! can i ask you a personal question? ho-how    do you shave your beard so close?|chandler| 
tom|  hey, listen. call me.|chandler| ok! 
ross|  i'm dead and no one cares?|monica| i look like a man??
chandler| please, one ridiculous problem at a time!|ross| it isn't ridiculous, look around! no one's here!
chandler| you gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class    checks the web site everyday and monica... it's probably the way you stand!|ross| yes, you're right. still somebody must have seen it... i mean,    i went to that school for 4 years, i didn't have an impact on anyone?
chandler| oh, that's not true. you had an impact on me, i mean, it's    15 years later and we're still best friends. doesn't that count for something?|ross|  yeah... 
chandler| i'm sure it's somebody for you. now, go hide. |kori| hi. i'm here for ross geller's memorial service.
chandler| kori? kori weston?|kori| yeah... 
chandler| wow! you look amazing!|kori| and you are... 
chandler| chandler, chandler bing. i'm not gay, i'm not gay at all.|monica| you are married though.
chandler| don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! |kori| i can't believe that ross is gone. it is just so sad.
chandler| i didn't know ross and you were so close.|kori| we weren't but we had one class together. he was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science. i always remembered him.
chandler| i'm sure that would mean a lot to him. and if heaven has a    door, i'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.|kori| i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.    i guess i really missed my chance.
ross|  but you didn't! i'm still alive!!    kori, i know this is a big surprise for you. it's a long story but the things    you just said really made my day! i mean, the fact that you are here means more    to me than if this room were filled with people!|kori| you sick freak, who does that? i can't believe i had a crush on    you! 
ross| did you hear that? kori weston had a crush on me!!|ross|  monica?
teleplay| sherry bilsing - graham & ellen plummer   story: brian buckner & sebastian jones   directed by: gary halvorson   transcribed by: eleonora, pheeboh, roni & vanessa|joey| monica, hey, can i borrow the porsche?
monica| ok.|joey| alright!
monica| but ehm...what is it not?|joey|  a place to entertain my lady friends.
monica| and what else is it not?|joey|  a place to eat spaghetti.
monica| very good!  what do you need it for anyway?|joey| oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't    sell tickets here in new york, so...
rachel| oh! so you're driving up to connecticut?|joey| yeah connecticut...not west virginia.
monica| hey, maybe i'll drive you up there! i'd like to buy some tickets    myself! |joey| uh!
monica| yeah with chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300    million dollars.|chandler| yeah, because if i was at my old job we'd say 300 million?    no thank you!
phoebe| hey will you get me tickets too?|rachel| yeah me too. oh! i have an idea. why don't we all pitch in 50    bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!
everyone almost simultaneously except ross| yeah thats a great idea!|ross| no thanks!
phoebe| you don't wanna win the lottery?|ross| uh...sure i do, and i also wanna be king of    my own country and find out what happened to amelia earhart.
chandler| still on amelia earhart?|ross| the woman just vanished!
joey| seriously, ross, you don't want in on this?|ross| no! do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? i...i    mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
chandler| yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck    by lightning 7 times.|joey| i like those odds!
ross| seriously you guys, i can't believe you're going to spend 250    dollars on the lottery, i mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.|chandler|  boohaki?
ross| oh oh, we think emma is about to start talking so we're trying    to be careful about what words we use in front of her.|rachel| yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit    and brotherpucker.
monica| how do you know she's gonna start talking?|rachel| well when i talk to her i almost feel like she understands what    i'm saying.
chandler| kinda like joey.|joey| what's that now?
monica| god! look at all these tickets! it's so exciting! you know i    haven't won anything since the sixth grade.|chandler| pie eating contest?
monica| oh! you assume because i was heavy that's the only way i could    win something? |chandler| no, i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
monica| that was a good day!|ross| they're towing your car, they're towing your    car!!
monica| i'm parked in a garage on morton! |ross| they're towing a car. and i am seeing...spots.
joey|  where's emma? who has emma!?|rachel| joey relax! my mother picked her up two hours ago. you were    there!
joey| i was?|racel| yes and you talked to her...
joey| i did?|rachel| she dropped off a casserole?
joey| oh yeah! the casserole lady.|monica| so, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
ross| yeah, uh... and then i figured after you win, we could all go    out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!|chandler| 
ross| think he washed his hands?|chandler| hello? hey charlie, what do you know?
rachel| what's going on?|monica| chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent    job at his ad agency. but out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.
joey| ooh! tough odds!|ross| yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state    lottery!
joey| look who's coming around!|chandler| damnit. alright call me when you know    more.
joey| did you get it?|chandler| one of the slots got filled.
joey| by you!?|chandler| sense the tone! no that kid nate got it.
monica| oh! i hate that guy! i mean come on kid! pull up your pants!|chandler| yeah i know.
rachel| well, there's two spots left right?|chandler| yeah...i mean i want this so much! i mean, i wanna get one,    i want my friend charlie to get one...except i don't care about charlie.
phoebe| hey you guys! ok, you're not going to believe this!    i just saw my psychic and she said i was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!|monica| hey that reminds me, i thought we could use some extra luck    so i brought a wishbone home from work.
ross| a psychic and a wishbone? guys! give someone else a    chance!|monica| alright, who wants to do it?
phoebe| oh can i? vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. it's really    not fair either! you know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we    don't like to play with the carcasses!|monica| ok, hey rach?
rachel| oh no, i'm good, i don't wanna get that turkey smell all over    my hands.|joey| i'll do it!! it'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
phoebe| i hope i win!|monica| well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the    same thing, right?
joey| i can't tell you what i'm wishing for! else...you know...won't    come true!|monica| right! .. but we \know\ what you're wishing for!
joey| can't really say!|monica| i understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing    for, aren't you?
joey| i'm not really comfortable with these questions!|phoebe| one, two, three!
joey| i won, hey!|ross| you know what, i'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you    guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!  ah!! that thing gets hot!!
rachel| you know, ross, just keep making your jokes. how are you gonna    feel if we actually do win?|ross| uh, you're not gonna win.
rachel| oh, i know, i know, the odds are against us, but somebody has    to win, and it could be us! and then how you gonna feel? you know, we're gonna    be all like \oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape\ and you're    gonna be all like \oh, i can't guys, i'll meet you guys up there, i gotta gas    up the hyundai\|ross| ok, i've heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that.
chandler| i can see the headline now: \lottery winners' friend filled    with regret eats own arm\.|ross| why would i eat my own arm?
chandler| well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever    we want.|monica| you know what, ross? i'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
ross| why?|monica| because i know that you think the lottery is \boohaki\ but we're    all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. and you're my brother, and    i want you to be a part of this.
ross| you don't have to do that, i'll pay for myself. but just the fact    that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! come here |phoebe| get a room!
chandler| ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?|ross| i don't know, probably just invest it.
chandler| ooh! calm down ...|joey| seriously, that's your fantasy? to invest it? 
ross| oh, i'm sorry, did i say \invest it\? i meant \be cool and piss    it all away\ |joey| ooh, ooh, i know! we should pool all own money and buy the knicks!
rachel| i don't really care about the knicks.|joey| oh, you will when i pick you as starting forward.
rachel|  you would do that? i never get picked!|chandler| you know, i'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
joey| you're not gonna let me buy the knicks?? i can't believe you're    taking this away from me!|chandler| you're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
ross|  uh, how long until they announce the numbers, mommy?|chandler|  uh ... mommy?
ross| oh, i've gotten into the habit of calling rachel \mommy\ when    we're around emma. which i now realize we are not ...|rachel| i'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first    word.
ross| although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me \daddy\    too.|phoebe| oooh, i like that, \daddy\ 
ross| i ... i was just talking about rachel.|phoebe|  oooh, is daddy getting angry? is daddy    gonna spank me?
ross|  no i can't.|chandler| hello? hello? oh, hey charlie. did anybody else hear? ...    what? susan got it?? how? oh man, i would have slept with him!! .. alright,    bye. 
joey| dude, i'm sorry. but hey, there's one spot left, right?|chandler| well no, charlie's gonna get that.
monica| hey, don't say that! you got just as good a chance as anybody    else of getting that job!|chandler| he's the boss's son.
monica| come on, lottery!! |rachel| ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
monica| ok, here we go. we need to sort out the tickets as quickly as    possible to see if we've won. so does anybody have any ideas how to organize    this?  ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups    of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.|rachel| ooh, i have another idea!
monica| i'm sorry, idea time is over.|phoebe| ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
monica| yeah.|chandler| what about the ones you have on the nightstand?
monica| there are no tickets on the nightstand!|chandler| yes there are, i just saw them a few minutes ago.
monica| un, no you didn't! you must be mistaken!|chandler| honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
monica| chandler, sense the tone!!|rachel| well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
monica| ok, fine!! i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler.|phoebe| uh! the psychic also said that i would be betrayed.
ross| i can't believe this, i thought we were all in this together!|monica| hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
ross| 3 minutes ago!!! i don't know why that's important ...|joey| i was with you the whole time we were in connecticut, when did    you even get those?
monica| when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off    the plastic!|joey|  i'll show you how.
rachel| ok, well monica, suppose one of your \special\ tickets win?    how are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?|monica| please ... if i win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave    me. someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and i couldn't get rid    of you for 3 days!
rachel| chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?|chandler|  she's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just    for us ...
monica| ahhh! |chandler| let me finish ... 
monica| there's the man i married!!|rachel| all right, believe me.if you win the lottery, it's the last    you're gonna hear from us!
monica| fine! don't be my friends! i'll buy new friends! yeah, and then    i'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!|rachel| !
joey| yeah, i want my tickets too ! and    i'm buying the knicks! and steffi graff, ah ah!|ross| than i want mine, too ! and if i win    i'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
phoebe| oh, you guys! we've got to keep all the tickets together |monica| no, no! we should divide them up  and i should    get extra because we used my card to buy them!
joey| hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! this all    thing was my idea! |chandler| oh, yeah! thanks for inventing the lottery!
rachel| ok, that's it! just give'em to me! i'll split them up! |joey|  oh!
phoebe|  ooooohhhhh!|ross|  hey, hey!!
phoebe| |rachel| oh, if she jumps, i get her tickets.
joey| no, no! |phoebe| if we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all!    so, say goodbye to your tickets! .
everyone| no!!|phoebe| don't come any closer!
chandler| can i come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting    squished...|phoebe| no, what's more important, your friends or money?
everyone but monica| friends! |monica| money!  friends...
phoebe| hey monica, what about your extra tickets?|monica| they're all in there! even these five that i hid in my bra ...
ross| monica!|phoebe| ok, good!  i think i broke your bowl.
ross| go, go, go!!|phoebe| what a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking    for tickets. and the wind sure made it fun.
monica| phoebe, we lost half of them.|phoebe| so, what? monica, we have the winning ticket! my psychic said    i was gonna win, remember?
ross| weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...|phoebe| as a matter of fact she said that's how i am going to die.  so, excuse me for being a little skittish.
chandler|  hey, there's two messages.    these could be from work!|monica| oh, play them!
chandler| ok, here we go! |message|  \i sh.. i shouldn't    have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. it-it was all my fault.    not hers. bye. coo.\
phoebe| well, i bet that was very hard for him to do.|second message| \hey chandler, it's charlie\
chandler| this is..shhh!|second message| \listen, oh... it turns i got the last spot. i'm really    sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. give me a call if you want.\
monica| oh god, i am so sorry honey...|all| oh, so sorry man! sorry!
rachel| oh, it is so unfair. it's like that time they promoted sandra    over me at work.|chandler| oh, is she related to ralph lauren?
rachel| no, she was just much better at job than me!|phoebe| guys, the drawing is about to start!
rachel|  you know what? we should call my mum's house and say    goodnight to emma before she goes down.|ross| oh yeah, it's a good idea!
monica|  honey, you've been really strong about this,    i know how badly you wanted that job.|chandler| yeah, you know, i really thought i deserved it.  but...    let's go win the lottery... i mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?
monica| |ross| 
rachel| hi mum, put her back on!|joey|  rach, come on! they are    announcing the numbers! my god, i can already feel myself changing.
tv| \here we are, the official powerball numbers! we have 53\|chandler| i got that!
ross| oh, we have one too!!|monica| we are on a roll, people!!
ross|  come on!!|rachel|  mum, please!i know you love your new lips, but    i can barely understand you! would you, please, just let me say goodnight to    my daughter?
tv| \and number 29! here we go! the powerball is 7\|monica| check your numbers! make me rich!
rachel|  guys, you're    not gonna believe this! i was just saying goodnight to emma and she said her    first words!!|all| wow!
joey| and what did she say?|rachel| she said \gleba\!! 
monica| make me rich!!|rachel|  isn't that amazing?
ross| oh yeah, no no no...that's great!|rachel| why-why aren't you more excited?
ross| oh, rach...oh...\gleba\ is not a word.|rachel| oh, but of course it is!
ross| okay, what does it mean?|rachel| i don't know all the words.
ross| i'm just, i'm just glad i didn't miss my daughter's first words    .|ross| yes you did, gleba is a word!
ross| ok, use it in a sentence.|rachel| ok... \emma just said gleba\!
ross| it's not a word!|rachel| okay, okay, okay, fine, i'm gonna look it up .
ross| oh, oh, ok, great. you know what, while you're at it she said    another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt....|rachel|  gleba! ha! here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain    fungi.
ross| she's gonna be a scientist! |joey|  damnit! anybody got anything?

chandler| oh no no no no, i'd love to be somebody's assistant! answering    phones, getting coffee, i live for that stuff! and i'm not too mature... farts,    boobies, butt cracks!|steve| chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. we're    offering you the position of junior copywriter.
chandler| me, that guy who just said butt cracks?|steve| yes, that's right. we're excited about the level of sophistication    you'll be bringing to the job.
chandler| ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. i'll see you tomorrow    .|chandler| what?  oh, yeah, i'm gonna be a junior copywriter.

joey| and i like to think i had a little something to do with it.|chandler| really? what?
joey| well, before, with the wishbone... i didn't wish we would win    the lottery, i wished you'd get the job.|chandler|  listen, don't tell monica, she'll rip your heart right out.
joey| oh yeah.|rachel| you know what? there is a little part of me that really thought    we were gonna win.
ross| me too. so much for my dinosaur/amelia earhart theme park.|phoebe| you guys, what was the powerball number again?
monica and ross| seven.|phoebe| we won.
rachel| what?|phoebe| we won!
monica| let me see!|phoebe| don't tear it.
ross| phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.|phoebe| i know that, but look, we've got the powerball number, we've    won 3 dollars!
chandler| wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for    the big payout.|phoebe|  i don't care, i've never won anything before,    i can't believe this!
rachel| so pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?|phoebe| it's not all mine. we all get 50 cents.
monica| you know what? you can have mine.|chandler| me too.
joey| me too.|rachel| me too.
ross| i guess if everybody else is...|joey|  hey guys, so i just called the powerball    hotline, can you believe it? nobody won.
phoebe| i beg to differ .|gunther| maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here    earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside, and won $10,000    .
joey|  god, you're beautiful...why    are we fighting this?you know you want it to happen as much as i do.|joey| i want you.i need you.let me make love to you.
rachel| i don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but    i think a canelope might hurt less.|joey| oh, ehm...i'm...i'm rehearsing my lines.they gave me a big romantic    story on days of our lives. it's the first time my character's got one. i'm    so nervous, you know, i really want it to be good!
rachel| woow!i haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog    food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!|joey| yeah, that was a disappointment... oh, hey!d'you want to    come down to the set and tell me if i'm doing ok?
rachel|  are you serious?|joey| yeah!hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown    out again.
rachel| hey, that was an honest mistake!|joey| right!
rachel| yeah, that was an awesome day!|monica| hey!
phoebe| hey!|ross| hi!
monica| so, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant    sometime in the next few weeks?|phoebe| sure!
ross| i'd love to!|monica| well you can't! we're booked solid for the next month!
phoebe| well, i can't give you a massage, because my licence has been    revoked again!|ross| phoebe, what happened?
phoebe| well, it was an accident...you know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes    the hand just slips!|chandler|  have i got a surprise for you? pack your bags!

chandler|  yeah, i'm going to vermont...|ross| oh, don't worry about it! just use your travel insurance.
chandler| i don't have travel insurance.|ross| well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
monica| why don't you take ross?|ross| uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? i mean, two    guys in a romantic inn...
monica| no, not if their room has two beds!|ross|     moonlight boat ride!!
rachel| hey joey, is this the bed where olivia lost her virginity?|joey| i don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  hey, listen    rach. thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!

monica| what are you doing here!|phoebe| well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so i am here to entertain!
monica| great!|phoebe| yeah! it really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!    yeah, \you suck\ and \shut up and go home\.
monica| listen phoebe...|phoebe| yeah.
monica| you know how much i love listening to your music, you know,    but...|phoebe| but what?
monica| this is kind of a classy place.|phoebe|  ok, say no more.
phoebe|     classy, uh?|chandler| hi, chandler bing, i have a reservation.
receptionist| welcome to the chestnut inn mr. bing, so where are you    joining from?|chandler| new york.
ross|  the big apple!|chandler| i'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every    maple candy stand on the way here.
ross| yeah, i ate all my gifts for everybody.|receptionist| i am sorry mr. bing, there's no record of your reservation    in the computer.
chandler| well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?|ross|  check again please!
receptionist| i'm sorry, it's not here.|ross| not there.
chandler| let me get this straight. i called yesterday trying to cancel    my reservation and i was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours    all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?|receptionist| i don't know what to say.
ross|  she doesn't know what to say!|chandler| just give us the cheapest room you have.
receptionist| unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe    suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.|chandler| that's insane!
ross| totally insane. dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple    candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree    and make some ourselves.|chandler| does that room have a closet i can lock him in?  we'll    take it.
receptionist| great.|chandler|  what!? they are totally ripping us off!
ross| dude, don't worry 'bout it! i know how we can make your money    back! this is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on    those! like those apples. instead of taking one, i'm... i take six!|chandler| great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
ross| c'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in    no time!|chandler| dude, you're shaking!
ross| i think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?|rachel| hi!
joey| hey!|rachel| joey, i gotta tell ya, i've been thinking all day about    that scene you did, i mean, you were amazing!
joey| oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good,    and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!|rachel| god, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
joey| ow, i'm just going over the script now! you wanna read lines with    me?|rachel| me? oh, no, i am not an actress.
joey| oh, all right, i can ask monica.|rachel| oh screw her, that part is mine!
joey| right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.|rachel| okay.  hello drake, i'm surprised to see you    here.
rachel|  kiss me.|joey| what?
rachel| kiss me.|joey| ah, rach, it doesn't say that!
rachel| no, i'm saying...|joey| but, but..
rachel| just... don't talk... |rachel| . well, that's new!
ross|  yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. |ross| what did you get?
chandler| usa today|ross| nice, put it with the others.
chandler| and i also got... two more apples.|ross| we are four short of a bush-o . god i feel so alive, i    love being in the country! 
chandler| i also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.|ross| oh, that's not cool.
chandlers| dude, none of this is cool.|ross| no, chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking    what the hotel owes you. for example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and    conditioners, yes, yes, yes.     i wish i'd thought this through.
chandler| i think i know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's,    but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.|ross| not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
chandler| ok, how about this ?|ross| no, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
chandler| yes, but the batteries...|chandler| thank you, thank you very much!
ross| let's celebrate with some maple candy!|chandler| no!
ross| at least tell me where you hid it.|rachel| can i ask you a question?
monica| yeah.|rachel| have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
monica| let me think. oh, when i was younger i used to dream that i    got married to mayor mccheese, and on our wedding night i ate his head.|rachel| ok, well this is like that...in no way. i had a...i had a dream    last night that i wanted to kiss joey.
monica| wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?|rachel| oh yeah! i mean, that was pretty intense.
monica| what do you think brought than on?|rachel| i don't know! i mean, maybe that's something to do with the    fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday.
monica| a love scene? with who?|rachel| olivia.
monica| olivia? i thought she was marrying connor!  oh right,    real life more important.|rachel| so do you think that my dream means anything?
monica| i don't know. i mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe    you don't have a thing for joey, maybe you have a thing for drake.|rachel| ah! well it was joey reading drake's lines in the dream...
monica| of course it was! trust me, when it comes to psychology i know    what i'm talking about. i took two psych classes in college. |rachel| you took the same class twice.
monica| it was hard!|phoebe| hey!
rachel and monica| hi.|phoebe| here, monica, look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant        right? i mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
monica| oh...phoebe? maybe i wasn't clear before. i really love listening    to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.|phoebe| right, yeah, ok, i'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out    of the vault.
monica| phoebe, it's not what you wear. it's sort of your songs... i    just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.|phoebe| oh, ok. fine, i'll just, i'll take the hat back .
rachel| hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...|phoebe| my songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
rachel| ok, we're still on that.|monica| i didn't say your songs were not good enough.
phoebe| then what's wrong with them? would they not go with your tiny    portions of pretentious food?|monica| tiny portions?
phoebe| yeah well, \excuse me, i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer,    but  i can't see it, i can't see it\!|monica| phoebe, it's not about quantity.
phoebe| well...it's not about quality.|monica| oh really, you want to talk about quality? have you heard of    a key? it's what some people sing in.
phoebe| well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. yeah, there    are other ingredients monica.|monica| ok, so that's what we're doing. you know, when i'm in the coffee    house bopping along to one of your songs, i'm wearing ear plugs.
phoebe| ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?|monica| you know what? i take back what i said before. you keep playing    at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales    are going up like crazy.
phoebe| what are people having, the garlic martini?|receptionist| here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your    stay.
chandler| oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.|chandler| oh, i didn't factor in the room tax.
ross| oh dude, don't worry about it, i found an unattended maid's car.    we're way ahead of the game.|ross| oh my god.
chandler| what?|ross| there's something new in the bowl.
chandler| look, we have enough, just walk away.|ross| no, but i want...i want the pinecones!
chandler| there's a forest right outside.|ross| it's not the same.
chandler| ok, go quick!|ross|  thank you for a delightful stay.
ross| oh, my maple candy!|phoebe|  food here at 'javu'..will kill you..the food here    at 'javu' ...will kill you..
monica| thank god, it's just you! i thought someone was swinging a bag    of cats against the wall.|phoebe| you'd better get back in that kitchen monica, the garlic is    not gonna overuse itself.
monica| ok, you have to stop playing now.|phoebe| why? the only person my playing is bothering is you!
monica| oh yeah? ok, let's settle this, come on!|phoebe|  get your garlic-peelers    off me!
monica| |phoebe| ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?  ha!
monica| alright, let me ask you this question: how many of you thought    the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .|phoebe| ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious    comma garlicky?
monica| ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention    never hurt anyone? |phoebe| ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was    fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .
monica| excuse us! |phoebe| oh...who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against    her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! 
monica| i'm sorry...|phoebe| i'm sorry too... 
monica| ooohh... hey! wanna stick around and i'll whip you up some dinner?  |phoebe| yeah! as long as it's free! food here is ridiculously over-p...  
phoebe|  who's hoping the hand raising thing    is still cute enough that you won't hate me?|rachel| hey!
joey| hey!|rachel| joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
joey|  oh man! i    thought i got it all!|rachel|  how...how...?
joey| i was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? |rachel| uh-huh
joey| and i couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and i thought...well... how important    can that be, right...? turns out very! |rachel|  wow...definitely just drake...
joey| what?|rachel| what...how is it going with drake?
joey| oh...i don't think it's going very well...|rachel| what...that scene i saw was so good!
joey| well, i'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting    tomorrow...|rachel| joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad    so i'll give you a compliment?
joey| a little. yeah no, i really am worried, you know, i mean i have    to make it convincing that i'm in love with olivia.|rachel| so?
joey| so...i've never played that!|rachel| ooh! honey, it can't be that hard, i mean, you've been in love    before?
joey| uh...well...just once...with you...|rachel| ok...this could be a little awkward...i'm just going to blow    past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your    real life memories to help you in your performance?
joey|  what the hell are you talking about??|rachel|  alright, alright look, just uh... just try    to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're    playing the scene.
joey|  oh! ok, yeah, i think i can do that. yeah ok, there's    this party scene coming up.. and olivia and her husband are there and all drake    wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... and that makes me think    about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't    know so i would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing    me.|rachel|  joey, you never..you never talked about that    before...
joey| well.. hey, you know what else i could use? there's a scene where    drake sneaks into olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which    never happened with us! and he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants    to look at her... you know?  but it was worth    it just to be there looking at you.|joey| 
chandler| i got you something from vermont! |monica|  that's weird...it's empty!
joey|  hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?|chandler|  well, let me see... i-i believe    i'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the tv.
joey| look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.|chandler| i could fall asleep at a play.
phoebe| what is it?|joey| it's a one-woman play called \why don't you like me: a bitter    woman's journey through life\.
monica| it sounds interesting!|ross| yeah, it does sound interesting, i mean, to listen to a woman    complain for two hours, i don't think it gets bett... 
phoebe| i know, i know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what    more do these broads want?|joey| you guys are gonna have a great time, i promise!
ross| what? how come that you don't have to go!|joey| i wish i could but i just found out that i have to be at work    really early the next day, so i can't go, but, you know, take the extra    ticket and invite whoever you want.
chandler|  uh, let's see, who do i hate?|rachel|  oh, sorry... oops, sorry.
joey|     hey, here you go.|rachel| ooh... oooh...  can i ask you a question?
monica| yeah.|rachel| do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and...    and not have it be a big deal?
monica| no, i don't think it ever works. why?|rachel| no reason.
monica| no, no, rachel?|rachel| yeah
monica| who do you wanna fool around with?|rachel|  nobody, forget it!
rachel|  maybe.|monica|  you can't!
rachel|  seriously i did not understand a word that    you said.|monica| in the hall.
monica| you wanna fool around with joey?|rachel| yeah! you know, ever since i had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head! and what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
monica| who? who do you know that are friends that just fool around?|rachel| ok, off the top of my head... don and janet.
monica| who, who are they?|rachel| i know them from work.
monica| both of them?|rachel| no, one of them...
monica| which one?|rachel| i don't know, what were the names i just said?
monica| rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.|rachel| all right, all right, you're right, i won't do anything    with joey, i just thought that we 
monica| what the hell are you cooking!|ross| hey!
monica| hey!|chandler| hey!
ross| hey, you guys won't believe what i have to do for work today.|chandler| yes, but, ross you chose a career of talking about    dinosaurs.
ross|  there're these two professors who are joining my department    and i have to meet them here and show them around campus.|monica| what's so bad about that?
ross| it's i just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing    tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.|monica| : ross?
ross|  these aren't suede.|charlie|  excuse me, i'm looking for someone. you don't,    by any chance, know a ross geller?
gunther| no.|ross| hi, hi, i'm ross geller.
charlie| oh, hi. i'm professor wealer.|ross| oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
charlie| it's a... it's good to meet you! thank you so much for taking    the time out to show me around.|ross| oh, no, it's no big deal, i mean, if i weren't doing this i'd    just, you know, be at the gym working out.
monica|  is he gonna introduce us?|chandler|  no, i think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
charlie| and, by the way, i really enjoyed your paper on the connection    between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.|ross| oh, ha, i wrote that in one minute.
monica|  twenty bucks says they're married within the month.|ross|  we should probably    get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
charlie| oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come    with us?|ross| i don't think so.
charlie| i'm pretty sure, professor spafford from cornell?|ross| oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is \if    you can't come on time, then don't come at all\.  shall we?
charlie| you don't think we should wait for him?|ross| you know what, he's a big boy, i'm sure he'll find us, ok?
professor spafford| professor geller?|ross| oh, damn it!

joey| i do it every year.|rachel| you do that every year??
joey| i didn't have to tell you that!! i'm stupider than jane rogers!!|rachel| oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us??
joey| yeah...|rachel| and last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant?
joey| yeah...|rachel| oh! and the year before that, when you set up that nighttime    tour of that button factory?
joey|  i can't believe you guys went for that one!|rachel| joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
joey| you're fine, ok? but everyone else acts like an idiot around famous    people!|rachel| well, then so you just invite me...!

professor spafford|  and then my wife and i went    on a cruise to the galapagos. there was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe.    there were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab,    and king crab. it's a pity i'm allergic to shellfish.|ross|     so, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
professor spafford| and that's not all i'm allergic to.|ross|  oh, it's not over!
professor spafford| i'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds,    and filberts...|ross| so basically all nuts?
professor spafford| interestingly... no.|charlie| kinda playing fast and loose with the word \interesting\.
professor spafford| if you'll excuse me i'm going to use the restroom.    |charlie| oh my god!!
ross| i've lost the will to live.|charlie| let's ditch him!
ross| what?|charlie| come on, he's still in the bathroom! i'm begging you!
ross| oh... ok, fine. but... ehm... i just have one question for you,    ehm...  when we exit should we walk, or run, or prance,    or stroll...|charlie| stop it, stop it! he talks slow but he might pee fast! ok,    let's go!! 
ross|  oh, hey you guys! this is charlie! charlie,    this is phoebe and my sister, monica.|phoebe| hi!
ross| yeah, charlie is gonna be joining my department.|phoebe| oh, you're a paleonthologist, too!  oh, ok, now, what    do you think of ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
charlie| well, i think he's a little out there, but he does have    some interesting ideas...|phoebe| ah, ah.
charlie| |ross|  ranion's theory of species variegation?
phoebe| yeah, i saw the article on your coffee table and i memorized    the title to freak you out!|monica|  so, did you two have fun?

rachel| ... ok, who is this?|ross| i'm sorry, rachel, this is charlie wealer, she's a collegue.
rachel| oh, hi! i would check your hand but... i'm sure you don't want    to get my chicken disease!|monica| hey, rachel, can-can i see you for a sec?
rachel| sure!  oh...|monica| you're not sick!
rachel| what? yes, i am!|monica| ok, then, why are you...  all dressed up??

ross|  wh-what's going on?|monica| joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof!
rachel| and he didn't want you guys to know about it but i came over    here to tell you!!|charlie| i thought you came to say you were sick.
rachel| ok professor or detective?|phoebe| joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
rachel| yeah, and he does it every year! that's why he's sending you    to that play! that's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that    button factory!|phoebe| and that horrible museum tour!

joey| hey, that's why i didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright...    go, go get yourself a drink or something...|monica| oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
phoebe| hey!|monica|  oh my god, can you believe we are surrounded by all    this? i can barely control myself.
phoebe| monica, you might want to remember that you are married. where    is chandler anyway? |monica|  oh my god! chandler!
chandler| where the hell is everybody?|bitter lady|  why don't you like me?! chapter one: my first    period.
monica|  hey! joey said no autographs! but if she's gettting    one, then i want one too: to monica. and none of this \best wishes\    crap. i want \love\.|rachel| ok actually mon, matthew was just giving me his phone number.
monica| oh man! if i had known i was coming to this party i never would    have gotten married!|matthew ashford| it was nice to meet you rachel.
rachel| nice to meet you.|matthew ashford| call me.
rachel| ok|monica|  we will!!
monica|  look at you with all the guys!|rachel| yeah!
monica| i guess you have forgotten all about joey?|rachel| yeah, well, i guess i have forgotten about joey and clearly    you've forgotten about chandler!
monica| please... chandler is the love of my life... |ross|  so, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to    leave boston, huh?
charlie| actually, i'm kinda happy to be leaving... i just broke up    with someeone.|ross| ooh... so sad... still, it can't be easy for you to leave harvard?    especially after working alongside a nobel prize winner like albert wintermeyer?
charlie| actually, alby is the guy i broke up with.|ross| you... you dated albert wintermeyer?
charlie| yeah...|ross| ... and you called him alby!?  i mean that's like... like    calling albert einstein... er... alby...
charlie| yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.|ross| eh, you think? i mean, you went out with a guy who improved the    accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
charlie| yes! and while that is everything one looks for in a    boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...|ross|  oh i'm sorry, i don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be    what regular people experience when they watch \access hollywood\.
charlie| ok, you want the dirt? alby was seriously insecure. i mean,    he was really intimidated by the guy i dated before him.|ross| who is intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize?
charlie| a guy who won two.|ross|  two? wha...? don't tell me you dated benjamin    hobart
charlie| yeah... for three years.|ross| oh my god! have you ever been in a relationship with someone who    hasn't won the nobel prize?
charlie| ... no... bu but there was    my first boyfriend billy.|ross| oh yeah? no, no nobel prizes for him?
charlie| no, but he did just win the mcarthur genius grant.|ross| huh... huh... what a loser! some more wine? 
phoebe| hey ross!|rache| how is it going with charlie?
ross|  oh great! after i finish my wine i'm going to    blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.|phoebe| oh, what's the matter?
ross| she... she only dates geniuses and nobel prize winners. oh my    god, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, i put chopsticks in my mouth and    pretented to be a woolly mammoth.|rachel| i always loved that!!
ross| of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!     man, i can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are    so out of my league! oh my god!|phoebe| worse?
ross| oh much, much worse. i did my impression of joan rivers as one    of the earliest amphibians...  oh, you... you like    that?|phoebe| 
ross| what? |rachel| come on! i think this is funny! 
bitter lady| well, i bet you are all thinkin' \now would be a really    great time for an intermission\, huh?|chandler|  oh yes, god yes!!
bitter lady|  how could he leave me?!?!|chandler| i... i don't know... you seem lovely.
joey| hey ross, this is one of my co-stars, dirk. |ross| nice to meet you.
dirk| hey! so what show are you on?|ross| oh, i'm no actor, i'm a professor of palaeontology.
joey| it's a science.|dirk| oh! hey well listen, i play a scientist on \days\. and    my character has just won the nobel prize.
joey| hey ross, listen, dirk was wondering about the woman that you    brought and if you guys were together, or...|ross| oh, well no, but i mean, she only goes out with really, really    smart guys.
dirk| hey, i got a 690 on my sats.|ross| i'd lead with that.
monica| that's it, just sign right on the bra .|joey| monica!
monica| don't worry joe, i won't come next year!|joey|  what have you got there?
ross| just some boys gave me their phone numbers.|joey| ah, let me see!  damn, that's    a lot of guys! are you a little slutty?
rachel|  i think i am.|joey| .    and this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three    and i don't feel any different.
joey|  pass, pass,    oh, pass, double-pass, pass...|rachel|  why, why, what's wrong with these    guys?
joey| nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good    enough for you, and you deserve the best.|rachel| joey, you're so sweet.
joey| that's true. but you know what, it doesn't matter because i already    know who you're gonna go home with tonight.|rachel| who ?
joey| me.|rachel|  really?
joey| yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!|rachel| oh! screw it, i didn't get it! 
joey| gotcha.|rachel| oh, very funny... joey.
chandler|  so, how did you enjoy the play?|monica| oh my god, honey, i'm so so so so so sorry.
chandler| well you should be. you missed the most powerful three hours    in the history of the theater.|monica| you really liked it?
chandler| oh yeah! i mean at first i hated it, but why wouldn't i, because    as a man i've been trained     but after chapter 16: \fat, single and ready to mingle\, i was uplifted.|monica| oh really!
chandler| oh yeah, i had no idea the amazing journey you go through    as a woman! tell me, tell me about your first period!|monica| no!
chandler| did somebody sign your bra?|monica| so i got it when i was 13...
phoebe| hey ross! so listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you    really just gonna let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off? what is that,    come on, a piece of paper?|ross| it's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
phoebe| go charlie! but my point is, ok so she dated them but she also    broke up with them. maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average    joe phd.|ross| yeah, maybe. i do have my whole career in front of me. i mean,    i can still win a nobel prize. although the last two papers i've written were    widely discredited.
phoebe| you're so much more than just brains! you're sweet, and kind,    and funny...|ross| and sexy.
phoebe| ok well give her a chance to see all of that!|ross| yeah, you're right, thanks pheebs, i'm gonna go find her.
phoebe| good for you! and hey, i thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the devonian era was top notch!|ross| stop going through my stuff !
rachel|  hey!|monica| hey!
rachel| i just wanted to let you know i've changed my mind: i'm gonna    do it, i'm gonna kiss joey.|monica| no, you can't! friends hooking up is a bad idea.
rachel| please, what about you and chandler?|monica| that's different! i was drunk and stupid!
rachel| well hello !|monica| what about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    why don't you just kiss one of them?
rachel| i could, i could but i don't want to! i want to kiss joey!|monica| alright . i think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
rachel|  i'm gonna do it.|monica| and i can't stop you.
rachel| no.|ross|  hey rach, have you seen charlie anywhere?
ross| i'm smarter than him!|phoebe| hey, thank you so much for these tickets, chandler.
chandler| oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and    i wanted to share it with you.|monica| oh, you're so wonderful.
bitter woman| why don't you like me! chapter one: my first period.|chandler| can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death    .
teleplay| robert carlock   story: scott silveri   directed by: gary halvorson   transcribed by: eleonora, pheeboh, sebastiano & vanessa|monica| it's so weird, how did joey end up kissing charlie last night?    i thought you'd end up kissing charlie.
ross| hey, i thought i'd end up kissing charlie too ok? but surprise!|chandler| i missed most of the party  charlie's a girl, right?
ross| yes, she is this new professor of my department that i did    not kiss.|rachel| i don't know why joey had to kiss her! i mean, of all the girls    at the party, god!
ross| why do you care so much?|monica| yes rachel, why do you care so much?
rachel|  i just... all i'm saying    is... i don't think that joey and charlie have anything in common.|ross| oh, i don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each    other's tonsils...
phoebe| wow, joey and a professor! can you imagine if they had kids    and if the kids got her intelligence and joey's raw sexual magnetism... oh,    those nerds will get laaaaaid!|rachel| all right, so... ross, you're ok with all this? i mean...
ross| yeah, it's no big deal. i mean, i just met her and i'm fine with    it...|ross| oh, god. i forgot how hot she was!
joey| hey!|all| hi!
ross| i'm gonna get some more coffee.|charlie| oh, you know what? i'll come with you!
ross| ok. |chandler|  so, a professor, uh?
joey| yeah! she is cool, and she's so smart! her mind is totally acrimonious     that's not    how she used it...?|charlie|  i feel like i owe you an explanation. i don't    ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. i'm... well, i'm kind of embarrassed.    i really hope you don't think less of me.
ross| uhm no! think less of you! no, i don't think less of you. i mean,    you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. i mean, those people who like    someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, i hate those people.|charlie| you know, actually i'm a little surprised to myself. i mean,    joey is so different from the guys i usually date. i mean, they're all professors,    and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral...
ross| yeah, i know the type.|joey| hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious.    no? am i getting close?
phoebe|  hey!|monica| hey!
phoebe| hey you guys! look what i just got. |rachel| oh, oh! wow, i love those! where did you get them?
phoebe| i bought them off ebay! they used to belong to the late shania    twain.|rachel|  phoebe, shania twain is still alive!
phoebe| oh... then i overpaid. |monica| hey, what's this?
rachel| oh, it's a gift certificate to this new spa in soho.|monica| oh, you can't show phoebe this! she hates those corporate massage    chains.
rachel| ah, why, now i can't get a massage? there are so many things    that she disapproves of! i can't eat veal, i can't wear fur, i can't go hunting...|monica| do you wanna go hunting?
rachel| well, i would like to have the option!!|phoebe|  hey, rachel!!
rachel| oh!|phoebe| no, you can't go there! you know how i feel about these \big    massage places\! they're putting people like me out of business!
monica| and she wants to go hunting, too!!|rachel| phoebe, come on, i don't wanna waste it! it would be like throwing    away a hundred bucks!
phoebe| ok, this is not about the money, ok? it's about... it's    about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.|rachel| i don't care about any of that!!
phoebe| well, do you care about friendship?|rachel| oh!
phoebe| i feel really strongly about this, rachel. please, don't use    this gift certificate. i'm asking you as a friend.|rachel| oh, not as a friend, phoebe!! fine, i won't use it!
phoebe| promise?|rachel| i promise.
phoebe| thank you. |rachel| but i am going hunting!!
monica|  hey honey! i missed you today!|chandler| oh, yeah?
monica| yeah.  what d'you wanna do tonight?|chandler| oh, well... maybe we could... 
monica| ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? know your audience!    besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank.|chandler| we really need to take those tests?
monica| honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. i think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. just a few routine tests.|chandler| but i don't wanna do it in a cup!
monica| what is the big deal?|chandler| it's weird! in a doctor's office?
monica| it's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do    it in a parked car behind a taco bell?|chandler|     and in my defense, it was a wendy's!
monica| look, i don't wanna do this test either, but i really do think    it's a good idea!|chandler| yeah, ok. i'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than    on a class trip to the hershey's factory!
monica|  oh!|chandler| oh, yeah! rachel talks too!
joey|  who says that wine has to cost    more than milk!|joey| heeey!
charlie| hi!|joey| come on in, how are ya?

charlie| and first, i have to see the met!|joey| ok, let me stop you right there. the mets suck, ok? you wanna    see the yankees.

ross| ok. let's see. oh, you should take her to the met!|joey| the metsss!
ross| oh, no! the met! the metropolitan museum of art.|joey|  you know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the muse! you know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion!
ross| yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry    baseball fans!|joey| ok, all right, so i'll take her to the met.
ross| yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on madison    avenue. you know what? she loves architecture, you know what you should do?    you should take a walk down fifth to the saint patrick's cathedral and there    there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.|joey| geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
ross| but i'm not! . you know what if you're in the mood for    thai food...|joey| whoa, whoa, whoa! slow down, you go way too fast. ok? just    go back to the met, ok?
ross| ok.|joey| you got to tell me exactly what to do there.
ross| ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities    wing. ancient egypt, mesopotamia, up to the byzantine empire.|joey| whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! so, i walk in the door and make    the right 
chandler| i have a weird feeling about this place.  how do i    know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.|monica| because, honey, i mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody    is gonna wanna watch that.
nurse| mr. bing?  here you are! you'll go into that    room and deposit your specimen into the container.|chandler| deposit my specimen? you know, usually i have to call a 900    number for that kind of talk. thanks, got it.
monica| hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going    to be ok?|chandler| yeah, i guess!
monica| i know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! no one here even    knows you!|janice| oh my god!!
chandler| oh, come on!|janice| ah ahahahhahaa! how great is this!
monica| hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!|chandler| why are you here?
janice| well, sid and i are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...|chandler|  no no no... i mean, why? why is    she here??
janice| oh! someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in    a cup! .|chandler| what!?
monica| this was fun! but i've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!    |chandler| i'd love to stay, but i have eh... 
janice| please... go!  just let me know if you    need a hand!|chandler| 
phoebe|  hello \ja\, it's time    for your massage, ja! put your face in the hole.|rachel| wow, a swedish massage from a real swedish person. 
phoebe| okay, then i'm swedish...|monica| so, what's your name?
phoebe| it's a normal swedish name... ikea...|rachel| oh... what an interesting name.
phoebe| ja!|rachel| you know i... 
phoebe|  time for your scalp massage!|rachel| 
phoebe| is something wrong?|rachel| no, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... ikea...     yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of sweden?
phoebe|  uhm... stockholm.|rachel| damn! i wish i knew if that was right!
joey|  note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.|ross| now, do you have any idea what you just said?
joey|  no, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!|ross| ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, monet is not spelt    m-o-n-a-y. i just... i wrote that out phonetically for you.
joey| phonetically? |ross| yeah, yeah that means... you know? we just... we don't have time    for this.
joey| ok.|ross| ok, but you know what? i gotta say, i'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
joey| ah! i'm an actor! i can memorize anything! last week on \days\    i had to say \frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy\.|ross| wow. what does that mean?
joey| no idea! but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i    guess it means \you're gonna get eaten by a bear\.|ross| ok! so let's move on to the renaissance?
joey| ok, caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. touch it, it's really bumpy! .|ross| nah ah! nah ah!  no no no! no ad-libbing    and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
joey| come on! you... |ross| no! 
chandler|  janice! you're not... gone?|janice| oh! sid is still in his room. i don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him. so did you do it? did you make your deposit?
chandler| yeah! yeah... the hard part is over!|janice| that's not the hard part honey! the hard part is what comes    next, i mean aren't you worried about the results?
chandler| i haven't... i haven't even thought about the results yet...    i just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.|janice| oh! well, you know what? it probably is.
chandler|  yeah, but what if it's not? what if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?|janice| oh, chandler, look. you and monica are meant to have children.    i am sure it's gonna be just fine.
chandler|  oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. i can't believe    i didn't even think of that. i guess i was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...|janice| what, you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?
chandler|  it was a \wendy's!!    \|phoebe| 
rachel| wow, ikea... what a rich culture. uhm, you know what? i have    a friend who is a masseuse.|phoebe| oh, ja! ja!
rachel| yah! she's... uhm... not very good though... |phoebe| uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
rachel| i don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy    fingers from playing crummy guitar...|phoebe| or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're    such a high maintenance tight ass!
rachel|  phoebe!!|phoebe| you know it's me?
rachel| for like a half an hour! man, you can lie about sweden!|phoebe| how can you come here?
rachel| how could you not tell me you worked here?|phoebe| i don't have to tell you everything!
rachel| yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting    a free massage!|phoebe| tips not included.
rachel| oh! phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?|phoebe| because i was ashamed ok? i sold out for the cash! and then    they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401k. but you know...    you pay a price. now i'm this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh!    paying taxes!
rachel| phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there    right now and quit! be true to what you believe in! honey, you have principles    and i so admire that! i don't have any!|phoebe| you know what? you are right. i am gonna quit. it's time    i took my life back!
rachel| good for you pheebs!|phoebe| ok.
phoebe| okay  if you guys have microphones in there too, i didn't mean any    of that. i love you.|ross| haha! got ya! die, die, die!
ross|  hey!|charlie| hi!
ross| hey, how was the met?|charlie| the museum was amazing!
ross| yeah? joey really knows his art, huh?|charlie| not so much, no. he had clearly memorized all the stuff to    say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.
ross| what do you mean?|charlie| well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere    around.
ross|  wait a minute... when you guys walked    into the met, did you go to the right?|charlie| no, we went to the left.
ross|  oh joey, joey! but still, i mean, it seems like    you guys are having a great time together.|charlie| yeah, it's fun .
ross| what?|charlie| actually, you know, joey is your friend, and you don't really    know me that well; it would be weird.
ross| what, i mean, a little, but no, what, go on.|charlie| well... i'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy    to be with right now, maybe i should be with someone... i have more in common    with. you know what i mean?
ross|  yeah. but you know what? i think you should give joey    a chance. i mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about    art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.|charlie| yeah, i guess that's true.
ross| and if you think about it, i mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. you know, that's the    kind of guy joey is.|charlie| he is very sweet. plus he's hot!
ross| that was going to be my next argument.|joey| hey!
ross| hey!|charlie| hey!
joey|  you're ready?|charlie| yeah, let's go.  thanks    ross.
joey|  hey ross! that art stuff worked, you hooked me    up.|ross| glad i could help man.
joey| although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna    be, but...  i made it work.|chandler|  it is not okay that i'm aroused by this now.
chandler| hello? oh hi, doctor connelly. |monica| hey sweetie.
chandler| doctor connelly just called.|monica| with good news?  \doctor connelly just    called! \ but so what is it? is there a problem, uh? is there a problem    with me or with you?
chandler| actually it's both of us.|monica| what?
chandler| apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable    environment.|monica| oh... what does that mean?
chandler| it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and    you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  it means...|monica| chandler?
chandler|  it means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us.|monica|  oh my god!
chandler| i'm sorry.|monica| i'm sorry too.
chandler| well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.|monica|  i know.
receptionist| good morning phoebe.|phoebe|  good morning receptionist.
receptionist| here's your schedule for the day. your first client is    in room no. 1.|phoebe| rachel green?  son of a bitch, she came back?
rachel|  oh, lucky me! coffee and a live sex show!|charlie| i'm sorry, what?
rachel| oh... oh, i'm sorry! i'm not... i was just-i was just reading to emma.|charlie| from... cosmo??
rachel| yeah, yeah... it's... \climax your way to better skin\.|charlie|  so, i have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, i'm soo bad at picking out clothes!
joey| so you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.|rachel|  not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
joey| oh hey rach!|rachel| yeah...
joey| maybe you could take charlie shopping.|rachel| oh, well...
charlie| i'm sure you have better things to do.|joey| are you kidding? rachel loves to shop! and she has great taste! yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
charlie| if you have the time, i'd really appreciate the help.|rachel| ok, uh-uh... let's-let's shop!!
joey| ... and some slutty lingerie, slutty!|phoebe|  that's off, right?
joey| what's the matter, pheebs?|phoebe| oh... mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. and she was like \oh, don't worry! i asked him. he's totally ok with seeing you!\. so now i have to go so he'll think that i'm totally ok with seeing him!
rachel| which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!|phoebe| exactly!
rachel| and you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!|phoebe|  aaargh, sexual politics!!
rachel| hey pheebs, i'm-i'm taking charlie shopping, why don't you come and i'll help you find something.|phoebe| ok, that'll be great!
joey| oh, ain't that nice? the three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.|rachel| that's not what we're gonna do!
joey| why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?|chandler|  wow! fortunately she has a very pretty face!
monica| oh, i so can't believe this! my uterus is an inhospitable environment? i was trying so hard to be a good hostess!|chandler| oh, i can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
doctor connelly|  hi there.|chandler| hi.
monica| hi.|doctor connelly| i'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but i wanted to talk to you about your options.
monica| ok.|doctor connelly| above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! so, keep having sex on a regular basis.
chandler| oh, damn it!|monica| don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
doctor connelly| ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.|monica|  ok.
doctor connelly| and, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.|chandler| is that a hint? because we love you doctor connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!  wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
rachel| hi! ok, you're ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping?|charlie| oh, yeah! let's do it!
joey| |rachel| not gonna find any clothes in there!
ross|  hey, you guys!|rachel| hi.
ross| guess who's up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference?|charlie| umh... kurts baley?
ross| yeah, right! what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  well, why are you laughing?|joey| just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
charlie| so you're up for keynote speaker! who's making the decisions?|ross| professor sherman, yeah. i've a meeting with him today.
charlie| he's a pretty tough guy to impress.|ross| yeah, well... i think i know how to dazzle him.
rachel| oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?|ross| tsz... no! .
chandler|  hey guys!|ross| wait a minute, you guys. oh, i wanna ask you something. i-i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do, i'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
chandler| i think i can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.|ross| it's in barbados.
chandler| but you come first!|rachel| i'm there!
charlie| we'll see you, guys! |joey| bye.
rachel| bye, see ya. |chandler|  ok.
joey| all right, so. how did it go at the fertility clinic?|chandler| not as much fun as last time. apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
ross| so-so what did the doctor say?|chandler| well... there's surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
joey| so you're ruling out surrogacy?|chandler| yeah.
joey| so, i don't have to learn what that means?|chandler| aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
joey| enough said, i'm there for you man. where is she, upstairs?|chandler|  ah-ha!
ross| how do you feel about all this?|chandler| i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don't think there is one.
joey| come on ross, be a good guy. step up and do it!|ross|  what?
ross|  what? no! i am not going to give them ben!|ross| the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
professor sherman| mmm-mm.|ross|  is that the repercussions could be huge! i mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, i mean, truly the mind boggles!
ross| oh, that's not what you want...|shop assistant|  incentive for men?
phoebe| oh, i'll take some of that.|rachel| pheebs, that's for men!
phoebe| no, i know, this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him cause i'm gonna smell like another guy.  yeah.|phoebe| ok. oh good, i'm dating a russian cab driver. . seriously does anyone buy this? i smell like beets!
charlie|  so, you know what, i really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. where do you think those would be?|rachel| on melanie griffith in \working girl\. i think what you want is over here.
charlie| see, i told you i needed someone! oh, you know, by the way, as a \thank you\, i would really love to take you out.|rachel| really?
charlie| yeah! actually joey and i are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?|rachel| oh, i can't. because i-i've seen them.
charlie| you've seen all the movies...|rachel| yeah! i'm a big fan! of the movies, you know. motion pictures. the talkies!
phoebe|  hey rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?|rachel| sure!
phoebe| ok!|charlie| wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!
rachel| you know that depends on what it is! i've done a lot of stuff.|phoebe| so what were you doing out there, do you not like charlie?
rachel| she's ok, i just don't get a really good vibe from her!|phoebe| why?
rachel| i don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! you know, and just swept joey off his feet... i mean, nobody else has a chance!|phoebe| who else?
rachel| anybody! you, me, you know, monica's mom...|phoebe| you like joey?
rachel| shhhhh! phoebe! all right, look. i have a little thing for him.|phoebe|  oh my god!
rachel| it's just physical and i have it totally under control! ok? it's just, when i see them together, sometimes i just get a little jealous!|phoebe| uh, wow! isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
rachel|  oh, i get it!|phoebe| oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.
rachel| i know, i know, so it is just not a big deal.|phoebe| yeah.
rachel| so can we keep this between us?|phoebe| sure!
rachel| ok, great, because i gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!|phoebe| oh.
phoebe| any chance charlie has a deaf twin?|monica| hi honey!
chandler| hey! look i brought a friend for dinner, this is zack, from work!|monica| oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, zack!
zack|  you too.|chandler| you guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! you're both polite!  go to have a seat zack, and i'll get you a beer.
monica| i got it.|zack| thanks.
chandler|  so, zack's pretty nice, uh?|monica| yeah, i guess.
chandler| so, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!|monica|  excuse me?
chandler| well, we're talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy! i mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, i mean, he is \spermtastic\!|monica| chandler, this is crazy! what did you even say to him! \come up, meet my wife! give us your sperm\!
chandler| no, i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! i mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.|monica| chandler!
chandler| i'm telling you, he's great! i mean, even if my sperm worked fine, i'd think he'd be the way to go!|monica| i'm not going to be a part of this! you can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
chandler| ok!|monica| uh!
chandler|  zack!|zack| thanks! do you have a coaster? i don't wanna make a ring.
monica| tell me about yourself, zack!|rachel| oh, god, do you think she heard? it would be so bad if she heard!
phoebe| well, maybe she didn't hear! ok i'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and i'll talk and see if you can hear me.|rachel| ok, great!
rachel| oh, thank god i can't hear a word that you're saying!|phoebe|  i didn't say anything yet!
rachel|  well, get back in there and talk!|phoebe|  i'm rachel. it's so annoying when i put emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
rachel|  what!?|phoebe|  well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
rachel| ok well, i heard that! which means that she heard it too!|phoebe| ooh! we have a problem.
rachel| oh! what are we gonna do?|stranger| just be honest with her.
rachel| oh my god!|stranger| and it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
rachel|  alright! enough out of you!|joey| hello?
ross| joey! hey, i need to talk to charlie. is she there?|joey| no. no... eh... she went shopping with rachel. why? what's up?
ross| i'm meeting with professor sherman about my being the keynote speaker...|joey| oh! how's it going?
ross| it could be better! he, uhm... he fell asleep!|joey| what!? but i already bought my ticket to bermuda!
ross| barbados.|joey| fine, i'll rent a car and drive...! ross, you have to get that job!
ross| what am i supposed to do? he's out cold! in fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named fran to spank him harder.|joey| well, just wake him up!
ross| i can't! if he realizes that i'm the one that put him to sleep, i won't get the job!|joey| uh! that's a tough one. oh! wait a minute, this happened to me before! yeah, i was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and...  no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... yeah i mean hey, shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
monica| hey guys! dinner's ready!|zack| oh! i'm gonna go wash up first.  thanks!
chandler| so what do you think? i want that guys genes for my kid! those eyes, those cheeckbones!|monica| ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
chandler| you don't like him.|monica| i think he is fine! it's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
chandler| alright! just follow my lead!|zack| you guys have such a great place here.
chandler| oh! thanks, i'm crazy about our place. hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?|zack| uhm... no. although i did have an uncle who voted for  dukakis.
chandler|  that's really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack.|zack|  okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.
monica| oh, friends first, drunk in london, you know the story. i've got a better question for you: do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?|zack|  no...
monica| eh... heart disease, alzheimers, gout?|zack| you guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?
monica| we're just making conversation. |zack| ok. i heard a joke today. it's pretty funny...
chandler| you know what's not funny? male pattern baldness |zack| ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and i'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. can we just talk about something else?
zack| ravioli's delicious!|chandler| i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. did you have braces as a child?
zack| no i didn't.|monica| yess!! 
chandler|  we're teeth people zack!|rachel| alright! let's just do it. let's just go over there and see if she heard.
phoebe| good plan.|rachel| ok.  wha...? where? where are you going?
phoebe| oh! i'm sorry rachel, i don't have time for your childish games, ok? i still have to go find something incredible to wear so i can beat mike at \who's more over who\! |rachel|  hey, hi! hey, where've you been?
charlie| oh! trying on clothes.|rachel|  oh! wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? well, that's so weird! phoebe and i were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. god it's just such a small world!
charlie|  rachel... i heard you guys whispering.|rachel| oh god. you did. you heard. ok, listen, let me explain.
charlie| no! there's nothing to explain. i heard you. phoebe likes joey.|rachel|  yeah.
charlie| it's just that... i don't understand it... i mean, phoebe likes joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?|rachel| yeah! that's phoebe. that's phoebe. you know, she just wants them all! it's like she's a nympho!
charlie| wow!|rachel| yeah...
charlie| you know, by the way. i heard you tell her not to do anything. thanks for sticking up for me. you are such a nice person.|rachel|  i try...
ross| |prof. sherman| 
joey| ... stop-eating hot! which is like the highest level of hotness!|phoebe| are you sure? because i'm really dreading going to this party.
joey| then don't go!|phoebe| mike knows i'm coming, and if i don't show up he'll think it's because of him! and i don't want to lose face! that's a very serious thing in my culture.
joey| alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over mike. and afterward you come to my place and i'll get you good and drunk!|phoebe| you got it! ok. but not on the wine that you made, ok, because i just don't want to go back to the emergency room.
phoebe| david?|david| phoebe! hi!
phoebe| oh my god! |david| wow, you look unbelievable.
phoebe| yeah. what-what are you doing here?|david| well, i'm back from minsk... permanently.
phoebe| what happened?|david| well, remember how i was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
phoebe| yeah?|david| well, after eight years of research i discovered that it can't be done.
phoebe| well, it's great that you're back! how are you?|david| good, good, life is good...
phoebe| good!|david| ah well, i-i'm seeing someone.
phoebe|  oh, good for you.|david| she's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, i mean, i saw what you had with that mike guy, and i just said \boy, i want that\.
phoebe| mike and i broke up.|david| you're kidding me. because i'm not seeing anybody, i've just totally made that up.
phoebe| really?|david| yeah, i don't know why, i'm sorry, i guess i just didn't want to lose face.
phoebe| i understand. yeah. ok so then ok, so we're both living in new york, not seeing anyone. that's so not like us!|david| yeah, i know. well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?
phoebe| well...  no.|david| do you wanna get a drink?
phoebe| i'd love to.|david| great.
phoebe| ok. |david| do you smell beets?
phoebe| oh, got it, stay upwind of me.|charlie| hey, there's phoebe! is that mike she's with?
rachel| no, that's david.|charlie| there's a third guy?
rachel|  tip of the iceberg.|zack| i'm gonna take off now. you're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
chandler| you sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?|zack| no, no, i should get home, i'm kinda tired.
chandler| are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.|zack| no it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. i'll see you tomorrow.
chandler| ok.|chandler| i think we've found our sperm!
monica| does seem pretty perfect.|chandler| yeah, you think so, well? should i ask him?
monica|  no.|chandler| why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
monica| no, that's not it. it's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, i just... i just realized i don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.|chandler| yeah, he's better!
monica| no, he's not. and if i can't get pregnant with you, then i don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.|chandler| really? are you sure?
monica| yeah, i'm sure.|chandler|  thank god, because i don't wanna do this either. you know, i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do. you know, i'm the husband, i'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
monica| that is so sweet. i love you. |chandler| so you know this leaves us with...
monica| adoption.|chandler| how do you feel about that?
monica| i think i feel ok about it. actually i think i feel really good about it.|chandler| me too. i wanna find a baby that needs a home and i wanna raise it with you. and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
monica| so this is it, we're really gonna adopt?|chandler|  yeah.
monica|  oh my god, we're gonna be parents!|chandler| we are gonna be great parents.
monica| and it could be soon. i mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there  our baby could be being conceived.|chandler| wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
chandler| hey, zack!|zack|  hey chandler.
chandler| look, i just wanted to apologize for last night. i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.|zack| no you didn't.
chandler| really?|zack| no you did.
chandler| my wife and i have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. we're working on it.|jeanette| .
zack| oh, thank you.|chandler| you wouldn't know if jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
joey|  hey! i'm all packed and ready to go!|ross| oh, that's right!  daddy and uncle joey are going on a trip today. we're going to a conference in barbados, right?
joey| mmh-mmh.|ross|  can you say barbados?
joey| barbados!|ross| ok, i gotta say. i mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! uh! and i've a surprise, uh... i had to pull some strings but i was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! that's right!  this babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
rachel| do you have anything that would... get us out of them?|chandler| yeah ross, i mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, \island's stuff\.
phoebe| i think david would probably wanna hear a few lectures.|ross| oh, right, because he's a scientist!
phoebe| no, no, because, you know, he's been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.|ross| ok, we gotta go, yeah? so, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
joey| all right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.|ross| it's a blanket joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
charlie| wow! this place is beautiful!|ross|  look at all these paleontologists!!
joey| i know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! |woman| oh my god, i can't believe you're here!
joey|  i think i've been recognized, this happens all the time!|woman| doctor geller, i'm such a huge fan!
joey| that... never happens...|woman| i've been following your career for years, i-i can't wait for your keynote speech.
ross| wow! this is very flattering, uh...|woman| i would love your autograph. 
ross| uh, uh... sure! uhm... \dear...\ |woman| sarah.
ross| \... sarah. i dig you\, uh? \doctor ross geller\.|sarah| thank you so much!
ross| yeah, oh and sarah... i'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, professor wheeler, a-and this is joey tribbiani.|sarah|  are you a paleontologist?
joey| no, god, no! no! no no, i'm an actor. you'd probably recognize me from a little show called \the days of our lives\.|ross| dude, it's just \days of our lives\... there's no the.
joey|  ok, ross! it's... it's fun, yeah! no, i-i play doctor drake ramoray.|sarah| i'm sorry, i don't own a tv.
joey| you don't own a tv? what's all your furniture pointed at??|monica| david, can you help me?! i'm trying to explain to chandler how a plane stays in the air.
david| oh, certainly. that's a combination of bernoulli's principle and newton's third law of motion.|monica|  see?
chandler| yeah, that's the same as \it has something to do with wind\.|monica| alright, i'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
phoebe| oh, i should go, too. oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should mike and i just meet you there.|phoebe| mike?? who's mike?
david| mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!|phoebe| that's right! oh, yeah... well, i've totally forgotten about im! ah! that's-that's... a blast from the past!
david| it's ok. ho-honest mistake.|phoebe| really, it doesn't mean anything. i mean, you know, monica refers to chandler as richard all the time!
chandler|  she does?|monica| 
monica| at least you took me down with you!|phoebe| i'm sooo sorry!! i just... i keep thinking about mike! i'm crazy about david, and we're having so much fun together. why-why do i miss mike? that's-that's gonna go away, right?
monica| i guess, in time.|phoebe| yeah.
monica| i mean, my feelings for richard are certainly gone.|phoebe| you just did it again. chandler, your feelings for chandler are certainly gone!
david|  well, phoebe's still pretty hung up on that mike, uh?|chandler| i wouldn't read too much into it.
david| still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?|chandler| david, let me stop you there 'cause i think i see where this is going. i'm not very good at giving advice. so if you want advice, go to ross, monica, or... joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
david| sorry, i just... i wish there was something i could do, you know? well, you know phoebe...|chandler| seriously, we're gonna do this?
david| i'm sorry, uh... i just wish i could make her forget about mike already, you know... why did phoebe and mike break up?|chandler| oh, because his penis was too big.  they broke up because mike didn't want to get married. hey, what if you just let phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
david| that's great! that's great! i-i'll propose to her!|chandler| what?
david| well, i was probably going to do it at some point.|chandler| i didn't mean now...
david| why not? it's brilliant!  thank you, chandler. sincerely.|chandler| well, you're welcome! glad i could help.
david|  how do you think i should propose?|chandler| david, i'm pretending to read here!!
joey| yeah! how you doin'? yeah alright!|joey| hey, hey! you said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?
charlie|  i didn't mean a thong... i meant thongs...|joey| you really should have been more clear about that!
ross| hey!|joey| hey!
ross|  you're never going to guess who i just saw downstairs!|joey| oh! ah! eh... britney spears!?
ross| yeah, she never misses these conferences!  no, i just saw dr. kenneth schwartz!|charlie| oh my god! did you talk to him?
ross| yeah... what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz?|joey| you could say: \hey kenny, how come you're not britney spears?\ 
ross|  ready to go?|charlie| yeah!
joey| wha...? you're gonna go now? i thought we could hang out?|charlie| oh i can't... i have seminars all day and i promised ross i would look at his speech.
ross| yeah.|charlie| but maybe we can have dinner later? on the balcony? will be romantic.
joey|  will you wear a thong?|charlie| i will if you will.
joey| oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!|ross| .
charlie| so you'll be ok?|joey| yeah, yeah. i've got tons of stuff i could do. i'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
ross| uh, joe, have you looked outside?|joey| no, why?
joey| oh man!|charlie| there's an indoor pool, you can swim there! 
joey| i wasn't gonna swim, i was gonna dig a hole! |monica| wow! that mike thing was interesting! i don't know what's gonna happen with phoebe and david.
chandler|  \i do\.|monica| ok, i'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
chandler| david is going to propose to phoebe.|monica| what?  why?
chandler| be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married.|monica| chandler, we have talked about this. you are not supposed to give people advice! now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
chandler| i did! a penis one! look, just so i know, what was so wrong about what i said?|monica| they've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike! she'll say \no\, david's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again.
chandler| man, that's some bad advice!|joey| oh! hey! thank god you guys are here!
rachel| hey! hey what's going on?|joey| everything is upside down here! it rains all day long, nobody watches tv and ross is famous!
rachel| alright, i don't wanna alarm anybody, but monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!|monica| ok! when i go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
chandler| that's why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross!|joey| come on, i'll show you guys where to check in 
monica|  oh, honey, can you make sure we get a king size bed!|phoebe|  oh! david, get one for us too! oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! and with mirrors on the ceiling!
monica| .|rachel| ooh! you guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. that's all, i just wish i could  share that with a guy.
phoebe| not joey.|rachel| not joey, no, i was just lusting after chandler.
monica| yeah, right!|david| so, ehm... i'm proposing to pheobe tonight. 
chandler| tonight?!  oh, there it is!|david| yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. that's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. and the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.
chandler| |chandler| monica, can i talk to you for a sec? 
monica| ok!|chandler| david is going to propose to phoebe tonight!
monica| see what happens when you give people advice? i hope you told him not to?|chandler| that would be advice!!
monica| ok fine. i'll handle this.  phoebe?|phoebe| yeah?
monica|  i need to talk to you.|phoebe| are you leaving \the supremes\? 
monica| ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. look, david is going to propose to you tonight.|phoebe| wow? really? that's fantastic!
monica| what are you serious? you wanna marry him? wha... what about mike?|phoebe| oh, ok, you want me to marry mike? alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. i can just see it: \mike, do you take phoebe...\  you know, it's every girl's dream!
monica| do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?|phoebe| sure! look, ok, bottom line: i love mike... david! david. i love david. don't look at me that way, roseanne rosannadanna!
ross| by using ct scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century.|charlie| it's great. you're gonna be the hit of the conference.
ross| oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because i won't be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .|joey| hey guys!
ross| the chocolates aren't here yet.|joey| damnit!
charlie| ross just read me his speech. it's fantastic!|chandler| oh, is it on the computer, cuz i'd love to give it a read...?
ross| if you want to check your email, just ask! |chandler|  may i?
rachel|  what's with the rain, geller? i mean, when i signed up for dino week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.|charlie| actually the wet season is june to december.
rachel| it's not the time charlie.|chandler|  oh, no, no, no dear god, no!
joey| oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?  oh! secret teapot?|chandler| your computer, i don't know wha... everything's gone!
ross| wha... what do you mean? |chandler| it must be a virus. i think it erased your hard drive.
ross| what, oh my god. what did you do?|chandler| someone i don't know sent me an e-mail and i opened it.
ross| why, why would you open it?|chandler| well, it didn't say \this is a virus\!!
ross| what did it say?|chandler| nude... ... pictures of anna kournikova. i'm so sorry.
ross| what... what am i gonna do? my speech is gone, chandler!|chandler| it's not gone! i mean, i'm sure you printed out a copy. you have a hard copy, right?
ross| no! i don't!!|chandler| well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
joey| it's really gone?|ross| yep! i'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
chandler| i just feel awful.|ross| yeah, well you should! i mean, nude pictures of anna kournikova? i mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
chandler| well, i tried billy jean king, but... |ross| get out! 
rachel| you know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.|ross| well, what do you do?
rachel| well, i usually go... play tetris on somebody else's computer.|ross| i can't believe this. i can't believe this is happening. i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! ok? i have to stand up in front of all these people. what am i gonna say?
joey| i could teach you a speech that i memorized for auditions.|ross| i don't think that your monologue from star wars is gonna help me right now, joe!
charlie| ross, we can solve this. i just heard your speech. we can recreate it! we've got all night!|ross| wha... what you really think we can do that?
charlie| oh wait, joey and i are supposed to have dinner .|joey| hey don't worry about that! i mean, ross needs you! and rachel and i will stay and help anyway we can.
rachel| ugh.|ross| alright, ok, let's do it.  and then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the triassic.
joey| oh, oh! any chance any of this happened in a \galaxy far, far away\? .|mike| hello?
monica| ok, mike, enough is enough, now you love phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole \i never want to get married\ thing and step up!|mike| who is this?
monica| this is monica! i'm phoebe's friend. listen, phoebe is back with david and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say \yes\ but i know she really wants to be with you!|mike|  he... he's gonna propose?
monica| i... i'm sorry, did you say something? i can't hear through all this damned hair! |mike| look, if phoebe wants to marry david, she should, i'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.
monica| you don't tell me what to do! i tell you what to do! just call her. she's at the paradise hotel in barbados. and while i've got you, you've got curly hair. what do you do in humidity?  damnit!|monica|  well, i hope you're happy!
chandler|  oooh! i hope you're happy too, honey!|monica| phoebe is going to say \yes\ to david. see, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
chandler| phoebe is going to say \yes\? that's, that's great!|monica| no it's not, b'cause she's still in love with mike!
chandler| and there's not chance that will work?|monica| no, i called him. it's not gonna happen.
chandler|  oooooooh! meddler! meddler!|monica| well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, i wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
chandler| this vacation sucks!!|joey| i'm so bored! stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
rachel| well, i've brought some books. we could read.|joey| hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
joey|  hey hey hey! don't mind if i do!|waiter| i'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention 
joey| hey rach, do you feel like going to a convention?|rachel| we can't. we're not pharmacists!
joey|  eva trorro... womba...|rachel|  kate miller?
joey| kate miller it is. |rachel| and... that's the most sex i'm gonna have this weekend.
joey| in that case should i make sure it's on real good? |rachel| thank you. 
charlie| and then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the mesozoic era in the 21st century.|ross| yeah, that's it?
charlie| yeah.|ross| oh my god, we did it! 
charlie| actually i did it ross. you remembered shockingly little of your own speech.|ross| yes, but i did make a pyramid out of the bath products. this is amazing, thank you, thank you so much.  that's a pretty necklace.
charlie| thank you.|ross| hey, what do you say we celebrate? champagne? 
charlie| oh yeah! hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.|ross| oh my god, i love you.
charlie| oh, this is such a cute picture of emma. and is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?|ross| that's ben, my son from my first marriage.
charlie| your first marriage?|ross| yeah.
charlie| you're married more than once?|ross| no. 
charlie| so, why did you break up?|ross|  oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? she... she was... eh... gay.
charlie| oh my god, this is so cool!|ross| ok, odd thing to get excited about!
charlie| no, it's just... i was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!|ross| hey! high-five! 
charlie| didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? my fianc was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.|ross| my wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. she didn't get any fitter.
charlie| right and then everybody finds out and they're like: \oh, i knew all along\|ross| i know! it's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? i mean, call, or leave a note: \hi, i just dropped by to say your wife's gay\
charlie| i know!|ross| and then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
charlie| i didn't do that.|ross|  me neither.
joey| well, who knew? pharmacists are fun.|rachel| i know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
joey| not enough pills in the world, rach. what about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?|rachel| well, let's see. there was a really big guy that i was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
joey| but what about back home, anything going on there? anybody you like?|rachel|  no.
joey| there it is, you're blushing!|rachel| no, i'm not blushing, i'm sunburnt! from, you know, the rain.
joey| you like someone. tell me who it is. who is it? |rachel| no.
joey| tell me who it is.|rachel| joey! 
joey| come on who? who do you like? tell me. you're not getting away that easy. who do you like, who?|rachel| joey, come on! it doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
joey| what? why not? rach, who can you not get?|rachel| oh!  ok. ok, you really wanna know who it is?
joey|  yeah, who is that?|rachel| do ya?
joey| yeah.|ross and charlie| hey!
charlie|  i just left you a message! ross and i were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner.|joey| right, of course. hey, did you guys finish the speech?
ross| yep, we got it, we got it.  thank you so much.|charlie| i had a great time.
joey| alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because i really wanna know who...|rachel| later! la...
charlie| so, shall we?|joey| yeah. 
rachel| ok. see you, bye.|charlie| bye.
ross| good night.|joey| night.
ross and rachel| ok, good night!|monica| i can't believe she's gonna say yes to david. she's clearly in love with mike.
chandler| you know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.|david| uh, phoebe, uh, i have... something i wanna say.
monica| oh my god, he's gonna do it now. please, i cannot watch this, let's go.|chandler| i think we have some time. have you ever heard him talk?  \uh, phoebe, uh, i would be honoured, uh...\ spit it out, david!
david| uh, phoebe, uh...  you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. of course the sanitation strikes in minsk didn't help!|phoebe| sure, ok, yeah.
david| but well, now that we're together again, i don't ever want to be apart. so, to that end...|phoebe| oh my god, mike!
david| it's david, actually!|phoebe| no, mike's here.
david|  hi mike!|mike| hi david. chandler. monica...  oh!
monica| it's the humidity!|mike| hi phoebe.
phoebe| what are you, what are you doing here?|mike| i have a question i need to ask you.
david| i have a question i was kinda gonna ask her myself.|mike| yeah, i understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.
david|  ok, would you care for my seat as well?|mike| actually yeah, that'll be great.
david| that's fair, you've had a long trip. |mike| phoebe, i love you. i mean, i missed you so much these last few months and i thought we were apart for a good reason, but then i suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.
david| kinda stepped on the toes of what i was going to say.|mike| sorry david, but she really has to know this.
david| alright, but after this i want to see you outside. if the rain stops.|monica| you're the most incredible woman i've ever met. how can i lose you?  now, i don't actually have a ring...
david| i have a ring.|chandler| i wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
david| phoebe, will you marry me?|phoebe|  no!
david| uhm... ha ha!|phoebe| i love you. but i never needed a proposal from you. i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
mike| we can have any future you want.|david| ok, i'm gonna take off.
phoebe| david, i'm so sorry, i'm sorry.|david| just so i know, if i had asked first...
phoebe| yeah, i might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.|david| please, you don't have to explain. i mean, perhaps if i hadn't gone to minsk things would have worked out for us. and i wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. it was a good trip! 
mike| is it ok if i hug you now?|phoebe| yes! 
monica|  because of our meddling! alright?|chandler| oh, ain't this nice? it's so quiet, i could just lie here all day.
monica| i know |rachel|  open your drapes! open your drapes!
chandler| i'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!|monica| the sun is out!
chandler| hey! remember when i had corneas?|monica| ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and i'll get the magazines and the lotion.
chandler| ladies? ross's speech is in 45 minutes.|rachel| nooo!
monica| damn it!|ross|  walls are pretty thin, guys!
ross| then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.|rachel| look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, i'm so jealous!
ross| finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: gigantosaurus, argentinasaurus...|chandler|  not to mention the cold sores.
ross| and that's just the herbivores. i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.|chandler|  really?
ross| but all kidding aside, in much the same way that homo ergaster  is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus...|charlie| what?
joey| he said \erectus\!|charlie| you're... you're kidding, right?
joey| no, he really said it.|ross| ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus...
joey| erectus?|rachel| homo.
ross|  thank you!|ross| oh, thanks guys!
man with a bow tie|  i thought... it was wonderful!|ross| oh!
man with a bow tie| jarvis oberblau, cornell. .|ross| 
rachel| all right! well, uh...  we're gonna hit the beach?|monica| yeah!
rachel|  it was really... great!|ross| oh, thank you so much!
joey| yeah, and so funny!|rachel| oh!
ross|  oh, i can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!|mike|  you're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!
mike| oh... i'm back!|ross|  ok!... uh... excuse me? yeah?
ross| hey! |charlie| you were incredible!
ross| yeah?|charlie| you blew them away!
ross| oh, i can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! i mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?|charlie|  i was not!
ross| no, it's ok! made me feel like a rock star!|charlie| oh my god!  i'm your groupie!
ross|  i'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!|ross|  look, i took it too far!
monica|  i can't believe it's raining again! oh, it's so unfair!!!|phoebe| well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.  not you guys. you got it going on!
monica| so, what are we gonna do today?|mike| they have a game room downstairs! ping pong and stuff.
monica|  honey, they have ping pong! let's play!|chandler| i don't think so!
monica|  why not?|chandler| because you know how competitive you get and well, i say it's cute, others disagree, and i'm lying!
monica| i'm not always that bad!|chandler| oh, yeah? what happened when we played last time?
monica|  i punched you...?|chandler| and...?
monica| ... phoebe...?|phoebe| ... and...?
monica| i clunked your heads together!|charlie|  hey! there you are!
joey| hey! |charlie| i'm sorry, i can't! i'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
joey|  oh... oh, but that's ok, i'll find someone else to do it... i'll do it alone, but... i don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...|charlie| you know... i feel so bad! i haven't seen you this whole trip and  especially last night...
joey| |charlie| actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!
joey|  oh! oh, well! at least we're both having fun!|charlie| yeah...
charlie| ... is it weird that it's not with each other?|joey| yeah! a little bit, yeah...
charlie|  i think we need to talk...!|joey| yeah... i think we do... ... about what?
monica| c'mon guys, it'll be fun!|phoebe| all right, all right... i'll play if we don't keep score!
monica| but then how do we know who wins?|phoebe| nobody wins!
monica| so, we're just four losers... super!|chandler| i'm not playing with you.
phoebe| yeah, i'm out.|mike| i'll play ya!
monica|  ok!|phoebe| mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!
chandler| she gets crazy! this scar  is from pictionary!|mike|  you wanna volley a bit for a serve?
monica| sure! got to!|monica| aww!
mike| oh, by the way... i'm awesome!!|chandler|  oh dear god, there's two of them!
mike| you're ready to play?|monica| hell, yeah!
chandler|  did you know this about him?|phoebe| no idea! i though he was soft like you!
mike| wanna make it more interesting?|monica| how much were you thinking?
mike| ten bucks a game?|monica| make it fifty!
mike| i'll make it a hundred!|monica|  one thousand...
chandler|  ok!|mike| to see who goes first, you got a quarter?
monica|  either of you girls got a quarter?|chandler| honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
phoebe|  monica, you call it.|monica| heads! no, tails! he-he-heads!
phoebe| tails!|monica|  ow, what are the chances!
monica| ha! my point!|mike| oh, no! i don't think so! you know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.
phoebe|  he was a lawyer!|alexandra steele| ... all these coasts having beautiful weather. in new york, it's 72 and sunny!
rachel| oh! weather bitch! |rachel| it's open!  hi, joe!
joey|  hey...|rachel|  what, is everything ok?
joey| uh... charlie and i broke up.|rachel| nooooo, why?
joey| oh well, she said we have nothing in common.|rachel|  oh, that's crazy!
joey| no, it's not, we have nothing in common!|rachel| ... yeah, it's true.
joey| i mean, she should be with someone like... ross! you know what i mean, he uses all those big words too! man, smart people are dull!|rachel|  what, hey!
joey|  ok, rach!|joey| i feel so stupid, you know? why... why do i keep going after the wrong girls?
rachel| w-what are you, what are you talking about?|joey| oh, c'mon, i mean, there's you, then there's charlie, and it's like... 
rachel| ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...|joey|  i'm telling you, rach, charlie is not right for me!
rachel| yeah, i'm not talking about her...|joey| but then who? the waitress i went out with last month? 
rachel| you know? forget it!|joey|  no-no-no-no, no! who, who were you talking about?
rachel| no, i-i-i-i don't, i actually don't know who i'm talking about! so!|joey| ok! all right, well... i'm gonna see if i can get a room for the night and i'll... i'll see you later!
rachel| yeah, sure!|joey| you like me? 
rachel|  ok, let's not make a big thing about this!|joey|  that's a huge thing!
rachel| not working with me, joe! here's the thing: lately i have been having thoughts  musings, if you will!|joey| what... for how long?
rachel| only like a month!|joey|  a month??
rachel| what the... dial it down!  ok, dial it up a little!|joey|  i just have one question!
rachel| shoot!|joey|  what the hell are you doin'???
rachel| i don't know, i'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... i mean, aren't you just a... little curious...  what that would be like?...|joey| uh, am i curious? i mean, i am as curious as... as... george!!
rachel|  who...?|joey| curious george ! you know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
rachel| oh yes, of course, i remember him!|joey| yeah, he had a paper route.
rachel| yeah, he did!  oh, see, this is what i'm talking about!|joey| no, i know, yeah i know we're great but rach no... this... this can't happen!
rachel| but can it... just... happen a little bit?|joey|  no, no! it can't happen at all!
rachel| but why, why not?|joey| because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok?  i couldn't do it to ross!
rachel| but that wasn't gonna stop you before!|joey| i know, i know! but i've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right...  i'm sorry...!
rachel|  oh god! i shouldn't have said anything!|joey| no! no-no-no-no-no-no! hey! hey, we'll be fine! li... hey, like you said: no big deal!
rachel| it's not a big deal!|joey| no big deal!
rachel| it's so not a big deal!|joey| yeah! i'll see ya later! yeah!
rachel| ok!|rachel| ok, i...
rachel| aaahhhh!|monica| ooh! i'm sorry! i think, i think, that may have missed the table!
mike| do you?|monica| ah, yeah!
mike| do you?|monica| ah, yeaaah!
mike| do you?|monica| ah yeaaaah!
chandler|  do you really find this attractive on him?|phoebe|  are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by monica, right now?
chandler| i think this is the first time in our marriage that i've felt like the more attractive one.|phoebe| c'mon mike, you can beat her! knock that dog off her head!
monica| oh, damn it!|phoebe|  i sleep with him!
mike|  game, point!|monica|  don't get too cocky! remember i won the last one! oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
mike| you know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.|monica| no, no, nooo!
mike| and that's how it's done! |chandler| okay-dokay, you've each won a game and i've lost what's felt like a year of my life. so everybody goes home a winner.
monica| best out of three?|mike| that's what i'm thinking.
chandler| should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?|monica|  serve the ball, chump!
mike| : serve the ball, chump.|phoebe|  ok mike, better come back mike, better come back.
mr. oberblau| i'm just saying, i have a cabin in the adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be  just nifty!|ross| ooh, well. ah, i kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that i wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. 
woman| jarvis?|mr. oberblau|  this is my wife, nancy.
ross| get out!|charlie| ross, can i talk to you for a minute?
ross| yes, please!  so, what's going on?|charlie| uh, well... joey and i broke up.
ross| oh my god, wh-what happened?|charlie| joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! i mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
ross| i knew that was him!|charlie| anyway i just, uh, i think it's for the best.
ross|  hey, you ok?|charlie| i guess. there was hum...  else.
paleontologist|  ok geller. last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.|ross| oh, professor clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
charlie| yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?|professore clerk| or we could throw you both in now!
ross| |mike| ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
chandler|  ok, look! enough is enough!|monica| no, i have just to have two more points to beat him!
chandler| monica, that was also true an hour ago! i mean, please, look at you! your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!|monica| i can't just walk away! i've put in four hours!
chandler| but...|monica| look! you knew this about me when you married me! you agreed to take me in sickness and in health. well, this is my sickness!
chandler| what about the obsessive cleaning?|monica| that's just good sense!
monica| |chandler| you ok?
monica| no, no, no. honey, i'm ok. shake it off!  oh my god! i can't play!|mike| so you forfeit?
phoebe| mike wins?|monica| i can't believe it!  i lost!
chandler| no, you didn't.|monica| what?
chandler| because i'm gonna play for ya.|phoebe| you can't do that!
mike| oh, that's ok. i don't care which of them i beat.|phoebe| ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
monica|  honey, you don't have to do this.|chandler|  yes, i do. now, i may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because i love you.
monica| but... you suck!|chandler|  you're welcome, sweetheart.
chandler| all right mike, let's get this over with. sudden death. whoever wins this point, wins.|mike| ok!
monica| oh my god! you're good!|phoebe| it's like watching porn!
chandler| and that's... how... it's done!|monica|  when did you stop sucking?
chandler| i never sucked, i actually didn't want you to know how good i was!|monica| why?
chandler| i don't know.|monica| this is so great! now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
chandler| that's why!|charlie| thanks!
ross| hi.|charlie| are they still looking for us?
ross| yeah. the bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores.  you know, we as a group are not the coolest.|ross| i don't think they saw us.
charlie| i don't think they did.|charlie| hum, so, i started to say you something earlier, hum...  there was another reason i realized it was time to end it with joey. i kind of realized i... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.
ross|  oh. can i... can i ask who?|charlie| i think you know.
ross| i think i know too but i've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...|ross| i'm sorry... we... we can't.
charlie| all right, all right.|ross| i mean, you just went out with my best friend, and i just think it'd be a really really bad idea. 
chandler| you know, i'd love to, but i'm a little tired.|monica| i'll put a pillowcase over my head.
chandler| you're on!|phoebe| hey!
monica| what's up?|phoebe| well, okay, mike's taking a shower, which by the   way there's  no law against. and then we're gonna grab some food, so if you   want...
ross| ... finally...|phoebe| is that ross?
monica| yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid   walls.|phoebe| sounds like he's with someone.
chandler| he could be alone. this morning i heard him do   push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.|monica| wait a minute, i think phoebe's right. you know i   hear someone else in there with him.
charlie| ooh... dr. geller!|ross| god, you're amazing... i didn't even have to ask you   to call me that.
monica| oh my god, that's charlie!|chandler| she's cheating on joey with ross!
phoebe| oh that tart... floozy... giant...|monica| i'm not sure about this.
phoebe| yeah, you're right. this is none of our business.|monica| no i'm not sure that it's  the best way to hear   everything. someone get me a glass!
phoebe| oh, i'm not gonna do this, okay? i'm not gonna eavesdrop   on my friend.|rachel|  ooh... i love barbados!  
joey| ooh... i can't believe i'm kissing you. i'm     kissing rachel!|rachel| i know, i'm her!
phoebe|  rachel and joey! it's rachel and joey!!!|monica| what?
phoebe| get over here!|rachel| ooh...
chandler| wow!|monica|  oh my god,   i love how thin these walls are!
monica|  thank you.|rachel| hey, you know, before you said     that nothing could happen between us? what changed?
joey| well, i only said that because of ross, you know. then   i saw him kissing charlie...|rachel| what? ross and charlie?  wow! she's really   making her way through the group, huh? ah, who am i to talk?
monica| i can't believe this. rachel and joey?|chandler| how about the dinosaur twins in the other room?   no-one is manning that wall!
monica| i'm on it!|chandler| anything?
monica| i think i hear curtains closing... |phoebe| we've got shoes being kicked off over here.
monica| bedsprings, unmistakable!|chandler| you do realise  that's your brother?
monica| not until you said it. somebody switch!  wait a minute... ross and charlie, joey   and rachel, phoebe and mike! we're the only people  leaving with the   same person we came with.|chandler| that's not true. i came with monica and i'm leaving   with weird al.
monica| okay, i've had it with the hair jokes. tomorrow morning,   before we leave, i'm going to the salon.|chandler| okay buckwheat!
phoebe| you gotta hear this, it's great... it's like free   porn! |ross| weh...*sigh*
charlie| uhm... is everything okay?|ross| yeah, it's just... i don't think i can do this...
charlie| ooh... is it because of what might be on the bedspread,   because i saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... i could   just...|ross| no, no!  look, i need to talk to joey. i mean, you guys just broke up.   before anything more happens between us, i need to know he's okay with it.
charlie| i uhm... i completely understand.|ross| alright, i'm gonna go find them...  okay, i see you later.
charlie| okay...|phoebe| that's the door. he's gone...
chandler| and she's... turning on the tv... and watching...   miss congeniality!|monica| honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it   too well!
ross| hey, what are you guys doing?|phoebe| oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying   goodbye to the hotel. 
monica| |chandler|  bye!
ross| okay, uhm... hey, you guys seen joey anywhere?|chandler| he's probably in his room with his current girlfriend   charlie. that's the situation as we know it... 
ross| well, if you see him could you please tell   him i'm looking for him?|chandler| you got it!
ross| thanks! |monica| other wall, people! other wall!
ross| |joey| oh my god, it's ross. what are we gonna do?
rachel| oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. just be calm. for all he   knows we're just hanging out together. right? just be nonchalant.  that's not nonchalant!|joey| no idea what it means.
rachel| oh... okay, just hide!|ross|  rach?
rachel| coming! try under the bed, try under the bed!|rachel| there's no room under the bed. 
ross| is everything okay?|rachel| yeah... 
ross| hey.|rachel| hi...
ross| you know where joey is?|rachel| ...i really don't... 
ross| can i talk to you for a minute?|rachel| yeah, sure... 
joey| i don't believe this... have you guys been...|phoebe| shhh... this is the listening side of the   wall.
ross| and then she told me that she and joey had broken up,   and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.|rachel|  uh-huh... right... yeah...
ross| and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the   day i met her.|rachel|  oh, i know... i know it's been   really hard for you.
ross| anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before   you know it, we were kissing. i mean, how angry do you think joey is gonna   be?|rachel|  that is hard to say,   ross. that is hard to say.
ross| you know, i gotta go find him. he's gotta be here someplace.|rachel| you would think!
rachel| joey!|joey| is he gone?
rachel|  how are you doing this?|joey| pssst...
rachel| how... wha... hey! what are you... what is this?   have you guys been listening this entire time?|phoebe| now, what is this?
rachel| ah, what is this? well, lets see, we kissed for ten   minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so i guess this is sixth   grade!|phoebe| oh no... have you thought about it how complicated   this could get? what about ross?
joey| well, he's with charlie now.|monica| yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything   really happens with her. and as his friend, i mean, don't you think   he deserves the same from you?
joey|  you're a pain in   my ass, geller!|rachel| all right, look you guys... look, we appreciate all   the advice, but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it...
chandler| okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you   do one thing for us? the people that  care about you?|rachel| sure...
chandler| enunciate!|rachel| get out!
rachel| are they right?|joey| probably, yeah... i mean, maybe we should... hold off   until we talk to ross.
rachel| yeah... yeah, we can wait, we don't have   to do anything tonight.|joey| yeah, i think that'd be best... so, so i'm gonna...   i'm gonna take off...
rachel|  although... |joey|  i like although!
rachel| i mean, you know... ross and i haven't dated in like...   six years...|joey| six years? wow... it's almost as long as highschool...
rachel| plus, you know, he is with charlie now.|joey| absolutely! he's not thinking about you.
rachel| no...|joey| i'm thinking about you...
rachel| yeah...|joey| let's forget about ross...
rachel| forgotten.|joey| what's wrong?
rachel| nothing...|rachel| nothing... it's really... it's nothing... come here,   come here...
rachel| sorry, i just uhm... i can't seem to get ross out   of my head...|joey| well, maybe i can help. 
joey| yeah... we really need to talk to ross...|both| yeah
ross| hey!|chandler| hey!
ross| you guys ready to go?|chandler| not quite. monica's still at the salon, and i'm   just finishing packing.
ross| dude! you're not taking your bible?|chandler| you're not supposed to take that. besides, it's   a new testament, what are you gonna do with it?
ross| learn about jesus...|ross| hey!
charlie| so, did you talk to joey?|ross| uh, no... no. i couldn't find him. i'm just gonna talk   to him on the plane.
charlie| yeah, sounds like a good idea... dr. geller!|ross| stop it!
charlie| phd|ross| you're filthy!
phoebe| hey, have you guys seen monica?|ross| uh, actually i think she went to the salon.
phoebe| oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...|monica| check it out!
phoebe| who's day just got better? chandler!|chandler| hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
monica| what do you think?|chandler| i think.... i think i can see your scalp.
monica| don't you just love it?|ross| ye... yeah... yeah... you got shellfish in your head.
charlie| it's so... something... you go girlfriend!|ross| you've never said that in your life, have you?
charlie| not once.|ross| i thought so.
monica| and listen to this... |chandler| what d'ya know... it's a treat for the eyes and the   ears.
joey| whoo, whoo. wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that i'm sitting   next to charlie after we broke up.|chandler| yeah, it's almost if air barbados doesn't care   about your social life.
joey| look, does someone mind switching to sit with charlie?|ross| oh, i uh, i mean, i... dude, i spent the whole conference   with charlie.
joey| i understand...|ross| no, i'll do it. 
chandler| wish i could switch with someone. i really don't   wanna sit with allen iverson over there.|phoebe| uhm... you know, once we're in the air and the captain   turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
mike| you should be careful when checking your overhead bins,   'cause items may shift during...|phoebe| aaah... you're not good at this...
mike| you don't have to go home tonight, do you?|phoebe| no, i think i can come over. it's saturday, right?
mike| oh...|phoebe| what?
mike| uhm... i can't do anything tonight.|phoebe| why not?
mike| i have a date.|phoebe| you have a... you have a date? with who?
mike| oh, it's... my girlfriend.|phoebe|  you have...  have a girlfriend?
mike| yeah... well, when... you and i broke up i started   seeing someone.|phoebe| for how long?
mike| three months.|phoebe| three months? okay... this is probably none of my   business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
mike| i'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. i   promise.|phoebe| oh, okay... good. you do that. and then when you   get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
mike| maybe i'll sign for it. tear it open. pull out the   packing material...|phoebe| you know what, we're gonna have sex. let's just leave   it there.
ross| right, i'm gonna go talk to joey. i think this is the   right time. he's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says \duty   free\.|charlie| okay... good luck.
rachel| ross is coming over. i think now would be a really   good time to talk to him.|joey| i guess so. i'm just... really nervous.
rachel| okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done,   they'll probably be serving dinner.|joey| ooh...
rachel| still nervous?|joey| i'm gonna get the lasagna.
ross| hey rach...|rachel| yeah!
ross| do you mind if i sit here for a sec.?|rachel| yeah, yeah sure! yeah! 
ross| hey!|joey| hey!
ross| so, i uhm... kinda need to talk to you about charlie.|joey| yeah?
ross| okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry   to hear about that, by the way... well, charlie and i were talking, and...,   well...|joey| you kissed.
ross| wha...  what? what would give you that idea?|joey| i saw you.
ross| yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else   happened, okay.|joey| ross, ross, ross... it's okay.
ross| what?|joey| it's okay. you know, i totally understand,   alright? you guys, make way more sense than her and i ever did, you know. and...   i want you to be happy.
ross| are you serious?|joey| yeah... now i have something...
ross| i am speachless... i mean the fact that you would put   my happiness first like that. i mean, you're an incredible friend, you know   that?|joey| oh... uh...  look... before you...
ross| no, i mean it. you are so loyal man, and selfless,   and generous...|joey| i am those things, yeah.
ross| you know what? i know chandler longer, so i always   think of him as my best friend, but now... i may have to rethink some   stuff...|joey| dude!
ross| hey, if there is ever, anything i can do for you...|joey| i can't think of anything.
ross| thanks!|joey| yeah.
rachel| so hi!|ross| hi!
rachel| so you eh, you talked to joey?|ross| ah, yeah. we had a really good talk.
rachel| oh! that's great!|ross| yeah!
rachel| oh, so everything's okay?|ross| oh, no, it's great. it's great. he is... he is an amazing   guy.
rachel| ah... well, obviously i think so too.|ross| well, i'm so excited about this.
rachel| really? excited?|ross| are you kidding? i have had some very dirty dreams   about this...
rachel| excuse me!  you didn't tell him, did you?|joey| i couldn't. he was saying all these really nice things   about me. i didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. i'm on a edge   on chandler.
rachel| oh god! alright, fine. you know what joey, forget   it. when we go back to new york, i will tell him.|joey| thank you. yeah, i appreciate that.
phoebe| hi, mike's place.|mike| hey, it's mike.
phoebe| ooh, that was fast.|mike| oh, err... no, she's not here yet. you know, i think   i'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...
phoebe| yeah, you can't do that! oh, come on mike, strap   on a pair.why don't you just tell her that we got back together. you know,   women appreciate honesty. we also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while.   just f.y.i.|mike| one more thing... there... might be a picture of precious   on my coffee table.
phoebe| her name is precious? is she a purebreed or did you   pick her up at the pound?|mike| anyway, i just wanna give you a heads up. 
phoebe| okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch   her tummy and give her a liver snout. |precious| hi, i'm precious, who are you?
phoebe|  i... i'm phoebe.|precious| phoebe? mike's ex-girlfriend phoebe, the love of   his life? that phoebe?
phoebe| enchant |monica| oh, i can't wait for everyone at work to see these...    ow!
chandler| you go back to work tomorrow night, right?|monica| yeah!
chandler| so if you want people to see them, then by definition   you're not  having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?|monica| well, if i had them taken out, then i wouldn't be   able to do this. 
chandler| what are you singing?|monica| it's \bolero\ from \10\.
chandler| it's \ride of the valkyries\ from \apocalypse   now\...   see, here's the thing: the corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy   hair problem. and now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore,   so if you think about it... i hate them!|monica| you what? you said you liked them.
chandler| did i? let's refresh. i believe what i said was   that i could see your scalp.|monica| fine, so you don't like them. everybody else does.
chandler| again, let's journey back... as i recall what rachel   said, was  she had never notice the shape of your skull before. and joey...   well, joey didn't realise that there was anything different.|monica| you know what? i don't care. i like it like this,   and i'm gonna keep it. you're just jealous because your hair can't do this...    ouch!
chandler| hit yourself in the tooth?|monica| and the eye!
ross| |rachel| that was one time, ross, and they were only like   5 milligrams.
ross| ooh hey, emma, daddy has some presents for you okay?   okay? i want you to wait right here. come here sweetie.|rachel| aaah... ross, actually there's something that i really   need to talk to you about.
ross|  okay, shoot!|rachel| okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
ross|  oh no!|rachel| what? what is it?
ross| oh, major shampoo explosion!|rachel| uh, look ross, this really isn't easy.
ross| oh, it's all over everything. why?   why me? |rachel| because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
ross| i'm sorry, i'm sorry. you were saying?|rachel| well, yeah... okay, look it's about me and...
ross| oh, not another one! oh my g... and this is moisturiser.   it's even harder to clean! why? why do bad things happen to good people?|rachel| wow! well, clearly this is not a good time.
ross| duh, you think? |phoebe| okay, bye. alright, so mike's on his way over. see,   you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at   the restaurant, so you know... doesn't really matter who's right or wrong.   point is... i'm gonna take off.
precious| i'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's   going on here. i mean, are you guys getting back together or something?|phoebe| alright... susie, can i call you susie?
precious| my name is precious.|phoebe| yeah, i can't say that. uhm... susie, i'm gonna be   straight with you... mike and i are back together... and uhm... unfortunately   that effectively ends your relationship with him. and he's very sorry about   that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
precious| i just can't believe this... why?|phoebe| well, i don't...
precious| oh, why would he do this? i mean, what's wrong   with me?|phoebe| nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.
precious| i mean, what the hell am i supposed to do now?|phoebe| damn it woman, pull yourself together! have     some pride, for the love of god.
phoebe| okay, not a fan of the tough love.|precious| i just can't believe that mike didn't give me any   warning.
phoebe| but he didn't really know, you know. he wasn't planning   on coming to barbados and proposing to me...|precious| he proposed to you? this is the worst birthday  ever.   
phoebe| look, precious... mike's not worth this.   you're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, mike's kind of a   wang. i mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... he was gonna   break-up with you on your birthday? and, i don't like to kiss-and-tell,   but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.|precious| oh, my god, maybe you're right. maybe i don't need   him. i deserve to be treated with respect.
precious| screw you, mike. you're a coward and a bastard,   and i hope you rot in hell. |phoebe| you're welcome!
chandler| honey, you've been in there for a long time...   is everything okay?|monica| not really. 
monica| i have a problem.|chandler| really? what happened?
monica| well, i was dancing around, and singing \no woman,   no cry\ and i got stuck.|chandler| you can't move at all?
monica| oh, well, i can move... |chandler| if i untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
monica|  i guess so...|chandler|  some of these look a little   frayed.
monica| yeah, i tried to gnaw myself free.|joey| hey!
rachel| hi!|joey| so, did you err... did you tell ross?
rachel| well, i tried, but then he had a shampoo related   emergency. so i guess now it's your turn again.|joey| no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... i think it's better   if you tell him, you know. it's easier for a woman. that way, you know, if   he gets mad, all you have to do is go... i didn't mean it. i'm so so--ooory. 
rachel| yeah, 'cause that's what we do.|joey| alright, alright, okay, uhm... how 'bout this, how   about this? tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
rachel| okay, that sounds fair. it just means that once again   we can't...|joey| i know, i know..., but that's okay. i mean, we can   control ourselves, we're not animals.
rachel| no! of course we can wait. alright, so i guess that   means good night then?|joey| yeah! good night! 
rachel| goo--ood night!|joey| good night! 
rachel| seriously, good night!|joey| stop saying good night.
rachel| okay.|monica| look what i found in the drawer...  and you said i'd never wear this...
chandler| now that i untangled you, how 'bout you doing a   little something for me?|monica| sure, what do you have in mind?
chandler| i think you know.|monica| really? i don't really feel like it.
chandler| this is what i want to do.|monica| okay, i just don't get why you like it so much.
rachel| we weren't doing anything!|joey| rach, he just saw us.
rachel| shhh.|joey| but what you saw, that is the                            extent of it, okay? one kiss.
rachel| no, come on, that is a lie.                            we also kissed in barbados.|rachel| yeah, you started it! i've got                            to chill.
joey| look, we probably should have                            talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..|rachel| we feel so terrible about this,                            ross.
joey| yeah, but it did happen, so...|joey| ross?
rachel| ross?  can we just                            close the door?|rachel| ross, say something. anything.
ross| so you two are..?|joey and rachel| yeah.
ross| and have you .. ed?|joey| no, no, no!
rachel| no, no, no!|ross| but if i hadn't walked in here,                            would you..?
joey| probably.|joey| no, no!
rachel| ross, this is not how we wanted                            you to find out about this. you have every right to                            go nuts.|ross| i'm not going nuts. do you see                            me go nuts?
rachel| no, but you know what i mean.|ross| hey, hey, hey... if you two are                            happy, then i'm happy for you.  i'm fine!
joey| really?|ross| absolutely.  but now that i've had time to absorb it;                            lovin' this.
joey| ross..|ross| it's all working out! me &                            charlie, and you two. you know what we should do?
rachel| calm ourselves?|ross| no. we should all have dinner.                            yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. i'll cook!!
joey| look, don't you think that will                            be a little weird?|ross| weird? what? what's weird? the                            only thing weird would be if someone didn't like mexican                            food, because i'm making fajitas!! 
joey| i do like fajitas.|monica| god, this adoption stuff is                            so overwhelming. there's inter-country adoption, dependency                            adoption.. there are so many ways to go, and this is                            like the biggest decision of our lives.
chandler| there's a hair in my coffee.|phoebe| hey guys!
monica| hey.|phoebe| hey, have you seen frank jr.,                            'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
chandler| you know, it's funny. every                            time you say \triplets,\ i immediately think                            of three hot blonde 19-year olds.|monica| that's sweet. drink your hair.
phoebe| hey, what's all this stuff?|monica| oh, they're brochures from different                            adoption agencies.
phoebe| ooh, babies! oh, this one is                            so cute, get this one!|monica| that's not really how it works.
phoebe| oh, how does it work?|monica| i don't know!
phoebe| well, if you're having a hard                            time, you should talk to my friends, bill and colleen.                            they adopted a kid. i'm sure they'd help you.|monica| thanks, that would be great.                            hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
frank jr.| alright, alright, alright.                            remember what we talked about. when we're in a public                            place, there are certain rules.|frank jr.| that's not what we talked                            about!!
phoebe| hey!|frank jr.| hey.
phoebe| good to see you.|frank jr.| good to see you, too.

frank jr.| oh, that's frank jr. jr.                            pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. and that's                            chandler climbing on chandler, and that's leslie throwing                            bagels at him.|joey| ah, can i just say i know we're                            doing this for ross, and that's cool, but if it was                            up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first                            date.
rachel| well, what would we be doing?|joey| i'd take you out for a romantic                            night. some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on                            the carriage ride home...
rachel| feel me up?|joey| in a carriage!
joey| hey, charlie!|rachel| hey.
charlie| hi, hi. so.. dreading this?|rachel| oh, you bet.
joey| so, did you bring a little something                            for ross?|charlie| actually.. it's stuff you left                            at my apartment.
joey| oh. oh, thanks.|charlie| and you know, you can just                            give me my stuff whenever you want.
joey| yeah, i didn't throw any of that                            out..|ross| i thought i heard voices! hi charlie!                             come, please come in. come in.
rachel| okay, well, we brought you some                            wine.|ross| oh! that is so thoughtful. 
joey| uh, actually, that's..|ross| underwear, a toothbrush, and van                            halen cd. i can use all these things!!
charlie| gosh, ross, you know, you seem                            a little...|ross| what? fine? because i am! aren't                            you? aren't you? aren't you? you see? who else is fine?
joey| okay, listen, hey, ross. why don't                            you try to relax, okay? maybe have a drink.|ross| you know what? that is a very                            good idea. i'm gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas.
phoebe| oh, god. so adorable. look at                            them sleeping there like angels.|frank jr.| yeah, i really cherish these                            moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be                            awake again.
phoebe| well, they may be a handful,                            but they're so cute.|frank jr.| yeah.
phoebe| oh, god, the last time i babysat                            them, they did the funniest thing..|frank jr.| i haven't slept in four years!
phoebe| that's a, that's a long time.|frank jr.| you just don't know how hard                            it is, phoebe. there's just so many of them. you know,                            two i can handle. two's great. you just hold one in                            each hand, but what do i do when the third one runs                            at me with his bike helmet on. i've got no more hands                            to protect my area! there's three of them, phoebe, three!
phoebe| yeah, i know, frank. i counted                            them when they were coming out of my area.|frank jr.| sometimes i think that..                            oh, no, no, no, i can't say it, it's too horrible. no.
phoebe| what?|frank jr.| no, i can't.
phoebe| oh my god, frank, are you thinking                            of leaving? because i didn't have those triplets so                            you could just run out on them!|frank jr.| oh, no! i would never do                            that. no. i just was thinking that, you know, maybe                            you could take one.
phoebe| what?! you can't separate them!                            that's terrible. which one?|monica| thank you so much for seeing                            us. phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
colleen| oh, please, we're happy to                            help.|bill| we went through the same thing                            when we were adopting.
chandler| so, a lot of malfunctioning                            wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?|chandler| i mean, you have a lovely                            home.
monica| well, we appreciate anything                            you can tell us.|colleen| well, actually, i think this                            might help.
colleen| it's pretty much all the information                            you need.|monica| oh my god!
colleen| everything is broken down into                            categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded                            to correspond with the forms in the back.|monica| thank you.  i                            think i just had a tiny orgasm.
bill| i know the process is frustrating,                            but it's so worth it. adopting owen was the best thing                            that ever happened to us.|chandler| that's great.                             can i see the book?
chandler| you want me to wash my hands                            first, don't you?|monica| it's.. it's just so pretty and                            white.
colleen| the bathroom is down the hall,                            to your left.|colleen| i would have told him to do                            it too.
monica| can i adopt you?|chandler| hey, you must be owen.
owen| yeah.|chandler| i'm chandler. hey, i was in                            the scouts too.
owen| you were?|chandler| yeah, in fact my father was                            a den-mother.
owen| huh?|chandler| you know how to use a compass?
owen| i have a badge in it.|chandler| you do? that's fantastic!
owen| you wanna see it?|chandler| i'd love to, but i gotta get                            back to talking to your parents. they're telling us                            all about how they adopted you.
owen| what?!?|chandler| what?
owen| i'm adopted?|chandler| i got nothing.
ross| the first batch of margaritas                            was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.|rachel| well, maybe the next batch,                            we could all get some.
ross| oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it?                            you know? just the four of us. just hangin'.|joey| dude, are you okay? and when are                            the fajitas gonna be ready?
ross| i'm fine! hey, i'm great! i'm                            just.. i'm just proud of us. there's no weirdness, no                            tension.|rachel| no awareness.
ross| we make a great foursome. we should                            do more stuff together. ooh! let's take a trip. okay,                            where do you think we - we can go?|ross| my fajitas!!
rachel| look, charlie, i just want you                            to know. ross is just having a little trouble adjusting                            to the thought of joey and me. you know, he normally                            doesn't drink like this.|charlie| oh, you know what? this is                            nothing. my father is a raging alcoholic.
charlie| oh, i'm sorry, have i made                            this evening uncomfortable?|ross| fajitas! be careful, very hot                            plate, very hot plate!!
rachel| ross, you don't even have oven                            mitts on!|ross| that is gonna hurt tomorrow!
phoebe| okay, well, this is crazy. can't                            seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids,                            can we?|frank jr.| no, of course we're not.
phoebe| insane.|frank jr.| i know.
phoebe| alice would never go for it,                            right?|frank jr.| oh, i don't know, she's pretty                            tired, too, i think we've got her onboard.
phoebe| well, just you know, for argument's                            sake, you know, hypothetically. which one would you                            be willing to give up?|frank jr.| huh.
phoebe| frank jr.jr.?|frank jr.| oh, you'd be getting a really                            good one. i mean, you know, he's really funny. like,                            the other day he made up this joke.
phoebe| uh-huh.|frank jr.| what's green and says \hey,                            i'm a frog\? a talking frog!  oh, no,                            you can't have him, he's too funny.
phoebe| well, alright, that's fine.                            what about leslie?|frank jr.| oh, no, no. not leslie. no,                            she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the                            alphabet.
phoebe| alright, so that leaves chandler.|frank jr.| oh, no, no, you can't have                            chandler, no. no, no. she's my little genius. i got                            big hopes for her. she's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..
phoebe| wow, frank. i think we just                            ran out of kids.|frank jr.| oh, i think you're right.                            oh, wow. phoebe, i don't think i can give one of them                            up. i mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're                            my babies.
phoebe| i'm sorry, frank. i didn't realise                            things were so bad. you know, i'll help out more. i                            can - i can babysit any time you want. you name the                            day, and i'll be there.|frank jr.| how about tomorrow?
phoebe| well, that's not good. but you                            know, i can move some stuff around, and i'll be there.                            you and alice just take the whole day together.|frank jr.| you'd do that for us?
phoebe| are you kidding? that's what                            sisters are for.|chandler| where are bill and colleen?
monica| they're in the kitchen getting                            something to eat. can you believe how nice they are?|chandler| we have to leave!!
monica| why? what did you do in the                            bathroom?|chandler| i didn't get to the bathroom.                            i bumped into owen on the way, and he didn't know he                            was adopted. and there's a slight chance i may have                            told him.
monica| oh my god, where's my purse?                            no, you know what? i can replace everything in there.                            get that binder, and let's go!|colleen| hey.
bill| some little snacks for everybody.                            oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. those are                            for owen.|colleen| i'll go get him in a second.                            by the way, you should know we haven't told him he's                            adopted yet.
chandler| but kids are so intuitive.                            don't you think on some level he already knows?|owen| i'm adopted?!
chandler| see? intuitive!|bill| what? where did you hear that?
owen| he told me! and he paid me 50                            dollars not to tell.|chandler| which technically now you                            should give back!
colleen| you told him he's adopted?|chandler| i'm so sorry, but you should                            have a sign out there or something. or at least whisper                            it to people when they come in the door. \owen                            doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that santa                            is real.\
owen| he isn't?!|ross| everyone? i would like to make                            a toast to rachel and joey.
rachel| ooy.|ross| and to love. ah, love. l-o-v-e,                            love. l is for life. and what is life without love?
rachel| oh my god, are we supposed to                            answer?|ross| o is for \oh, wow!\                            the v is for this very surprising turn of events, which                            i'm still fine with by the way. e is for how extremely                            normal i find it. that you two are together. and now                            one day you might get married and have children of your                            own.
joey| dude, are you okay?|ross| totally.
rachel| ross, you don't seem okay.|charlie| wait, ross. ross. i - i have                            to take off.
ross| no!|charlie| i'm sorry, i have a really                            early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.
ross| wasn't it? and you thought it                            would be awkward with joey and that you never really                            liked rachel.|charlie| you're on fire! i'll call you                            in the morning, okay?
ross| okay.|charlie| alright.
charlie| god, rachel, what ross just                            said that is just so..|rachel| oh, that's okay, girls tend                            not to like me.
charlie| bye.|ross| okay, i guess it's just flan for                            three! hey, hey, that rhymed!
rachel| you know what, ross? i think                            we're gonna take off too.|ross| oh, oh. of course. god, i'm so                            stupid. you guys are a couple now. i mean, you probably                            just want to be alone.
rachel| no, no, it's just that it's                            getting late...|ross| hey, hey, it's fine. it's totally                            fine. we've got plenty of margaritas. it's all good.
ross| i don't even know what that's                            for.|joey| you know what? i think i'm gonna                            stay here and make sure he's okay.
rachel| yeah, that's probably a good                            idea.|joey| yeah. i'll see you in the morning.
rachel| uh-huh. okay. you know what,                            joey, i don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.|joey| it doesn't look good, does it?
joey| morning. here you go.|ross| thanks. did you stay here all                            night?
joey| yeah.|ross| so you took off my pants and shoes?
joey| no, no, no. you actually did that                            when you were dancing to the chicago-soundtrack. look,                            ross, about, about rachel and i. listen, you don't have                            to worry about that, okay? because nothing is gonna                            happen.|ross| what do you mean?
joey| well, she and i said from the                            beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you                            were okay with it. and clearly..|ross| hey, what are you talking about?                            i'm fine!
joey| it's okay, ross, alright? i totally                            understand. of course you're not fine. you're.. you're                            ross and rachel.|ross| except we're not. i mean, we haven't                            been a couple in like, six years. oh my god, is that                            right? has it been that long?
joey| that's what i hear, yeah.|ross| this is crazy. i mean, six years?                            and because of me you guys aren't gonna be together?                            can i ask you something? really, what is this thing                            with you and rachel?
joey| come on, i mean, you know me,                            you know...|ross| joey.

monica| i can't believe                              you tried to cut me out. why phoebe, why?|phoebe| it was right                              after we were living together and you were driving                              me crazy, okay? you were really controlling and compulsive                              and shrill.
monica| i'm still all                              those things!|phoebe| you're also so                              generous and kind and scrappy!
monica|                               i am scrappy.|phoebe| exactly! look,                              no matter what i tried to do, i couldn't keep you                              out of my life. of all the people i have cut out,                              you were the only one who ever clawed her way back                              in.
monica| it's because                              i'm scrappy.|phoebe| yeah, you are.                              and i'm so glad that you fought your way back in,                              because i don't know what i would do without you.
monica| i won't know                              what i would do without you.|monica| well, i guess                              we should go back in. when you gave me another chance,                              i guess we should do the same for amanda.
phoebe| yeah, i guess                              you're right.|amanda| can you believe                              it. i've never had any professional dance training.
glenda| now, let me explain                              how this works. you go into the booth, and...|ross| i'm gonna stop                              you right there, glenda. okay? does it look like this                              is my first time, huh? now i want 4 two's... and i                              want them all on my back.
glenda|  okay...|ross| wait a minute,                              there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
ross| which... which...                              which... which one is it?|ross| oh! son of a bitch!
rachel| what is the matter                              with us?|joey| well, i know what's                              the matter with me.
rachel| no, i mean with                              us, you know. i mean, is it supposed to be this...                              difficult?|joey| i don't know.
chandler| that fake british                              woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... hey!|rachel| hi! hey, listen,                              can we ask you a question? when you and monica first                              hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more                              than that?
chandler| kinda... you                              know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...|rachel| no, no, no...                              no, i mean... se-x-u-ally...
joey| yeah, was there                              a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?|chandler| actually, no.                              no, it felt right. you know, it felt like uhm... i                              can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole                              time.
chandler| i can tell                              from your expressions that that's the good news you                              were hoping for... well, i'm gonna go continue to...                              spread the joy.|rachel| well, just because                              it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has                              to happen that way for us.
joey| yeah, yeah... absolutely.                              i mean, just because something's difficult doesn't                              mean that you quit.|rachel| right, totally.
joey| yeah, so we just                              keep trying and trying until we... do it.|rachel| yeah, and if                              doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples                              that never have sex.
joey| that's a... pla-an.|joey|  wow...                              i did not see this coming.
rachel| i know.|joey| i don't get it.                              i mean, i was so sure this was what i wanted. 
rachel| hmmm... me too...|rachel| i wonder how                              monica and chandler could do it?
joey| i guess they weren't                              as good friends as we are.|rachel| aah... i bet                              you're right.
joey| so...|rachel| yeah.
joey| i love ya.|rachel| love you too...                              alright, i'm going to bed.
joey| yeah, me too.|joey| ooh, yeah, i'm                              not going anywhere for a while.
chandler| dude, it's                              chandler. let me in.|ross| go away! i don't                              want to see anybody.
chandler| i know, i went                              to the tanning place and the same thing happened to                              me. you have to let me in.|ross| really? did you                              count mississipily?
ross| dude, you're not                              tanned.|chandler| no, i just                              had to get a picture of this.
monica|                               hey guys!|chandler|                              honey, i got us that room at the woodford inn this                              weekend.
monica|                              that place in vermont? you can take a hint!|rachel|                              wait, you can't go away this weekend! it's emma's                              birthday!
ross| yeah!|rachel|                              we're having a party.
monica|                              well, can't you just have the party when we get back?|ross| no.
rachel|                              no, that day... that won't be her real birthday!|chandler|                              gee if only she were one and had no idea what the                              hell a birthday was!
ross| c'mon                              you guys, this is really important to us.|monica|                              well, i'm sorry, but chandler and i could really use                              a weekend away. you know, to reconnect... emotionally.
chandler|                              there's this thing i really want us to do. i read                              about it in maxim...|rachel|                              well, can't you just go to vermont the next day?
ross| yeah,                              we want everyone to be there. as much as i hate to                              delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.|rachel|                              and i mean, you know, you guys... this is a big deal.                              i mean, how can we have her first birthday party without                              her aunt and her uncle!
monica|                              all right, we'll stay. we can just drive up after                              the party.|chandler|                              fine, but if we end up not doing this maxim thing                              because of this party...
monica|                              believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!|phoebe|                              oooh, i love family traditions like that. when uhm...                              when ursula and i were kids, on our birthday, our                              stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
ross|  hey guys!|ross| hey,                              i brought the camera for emma's video.
rachel|                              oh, good, good! we had this idea to make a birthday                              video for emma and we'll give it to her when she is                              18.|phoebe|                              oh, cool!! wow, it's like a time capsule!
ross| yeah!|phoebe|                              oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video                              on a tv that hasn't even been invented yet! with friends                              who right now are just like babies! and they'll be                              living in a floating city that the humans built to                              escape the ant people!
ross| that's                              the hope! so, is emma awake yet?|rachel|                              oh no, it's still nap time. but she'll be up soon.
ross| ah,                              and where is joey?|rachel|                              i said it's still nap time.
ross|  hey, there is uncle joey!|joey| hey!
ross| hey,                              say something to emma on her 18th birthday!|joey| 18,                              uh? 
ross| joey,                              no!|joey| what,                              what!? it's for her hot friends!
ross| when                              they see this you'll be 52!|joey| and                              starting to think about settling down!
rachel|                              hey joey, will you please set this up for people to                              put emma's presents on?|joey| i'd                              love to! yeah! 
joey|  we were supposed to bring presents?|phoebe|                              yeah! i wrote emma a song.
joey| oh,                              yeah! how was i supposed to know?|phoebe|                              joey, it's a birthday party.
joey| yeah,                              but for a one-year-old. what's the point... the other                              day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. just a                              cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer.                              and he's standing next to this cow and the cow says                              \el-moo\!  yeah...                              that's a funny cup!|monica|                              hey!
chandler|                              hey hey! where's the birthday girl?|rachel|                              oh, she's still napping
chandler|                              oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about                              the party she knows is happening.|rachel|                              look, i know that you guys really want to get to vermont                              and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really                              is to us, ok? emma will never have a first birthday                              again.
monica|                              all right... you're right. we're sorry. now let's                              wake up emma and get the fun time started!|rachel|                              no really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we                              can't wake her up.
monica|                              are you freaking kidding me, green?|ross|                               hey!

rachel|                              well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes,                              in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo,                              theyll copy it in icing!|monica|                              oh, did you do a picture of emma?
rachel|                              yes! on a cake shaped like a bunny.|ross| uh,                              rach? does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic                              cakes? say for bachelorette parties?

ross| i                              am this close to tugging on my testicles again.|ross| ask                              them if it would be faster if we cut the babys                              face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny.                              . that is a weird sentence!

chandler|                              they left.|rachel|                               bye...
ross| rachel!|rachel|                              ooh! god! sorry!
ross|                               i can't believe they gave you a ticket. you're such                              a good driver.|rachel|                              emma's awake.
ross| yeah?|rachel|                              i can't believe this. this is her first birthday.                              she's awake. we're not even there. everybody left.                              we still have this stupid obscene cake.
ross| hey,                              maybe i can fix that, you know. try to turn it into                              something else. |rachel|                              oh, why do you even bother? i already ruined her first                              birthday... and do you know how important these early                              experiences are ross? very! according to the back                              cover of that book that you gave me.
ross| rach,                              she's not going to remember this.|rachel|                               they have to learn!
ross|  hey!|rachel|                              what?
ross| it's                              not bad.|rachel|                               oh my god! look what... you                              made it into a bunny. how did you do that?
ross| well,                              i just made these two things uhm... cheeks. and then                              i split this to make ears.|rachel|                              well, i'm very impressed.
ross| some                              can sing, some can dance. i apparently can turn phallic                              cakes into woodland creatures.|monica|                              now another way to organise your stuffed animals,                              is by size.
chandler|                              i'm sorry, is this a game for emma or for monica?|monica|                              game?

amy| well, if i had                              told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now                              would it?|chandler| i think she                              looks cute.  ... but i am wrong!

mike| why?|phoebe| well, if you                              don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all                              the nutrients.

monica| oh, well. now that i'm here i might as well                            help you with the cleaning and organizing! just happen                            to have my label maker!|phoebe| oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! did you                            and chandler have to make compromises when you first                            moved in together?
monica| uh, chandler did! what does he want you to                            give up?|phoebe| a bunch of stuff. and the worst one... he wants                            me to get rid of gladys.
monica| who's gladys?  oh! what                            a tragic loss!|phoebe| yeah. i really hate to give her up. oh, i know!!                            oh, you should take her!
monica|  well, i-i-i-i... i don't                            know...|phoebe| why, you don't like her?
monica| well, of course i do. what's not to like! i'll                            take her in a minute! but, you know, i think that you're                            giving up too easy, honey. i think that you need to                            fight for her!|phoebe| really? you think?
monica| absolutely! yes, you say to him \i'm sorry                            mike i can't live without her, she means too much to                            me!\|phoebe| ok, i'll fight for her. ok! oh, wait, oh i                            just realized... if i do that, that means you don't                            get her.
monica| damn it, i did not think this through!|chandler| hey you guys. 
rachel| hi!|joey| oh! any word on casting yet?
chandler| joe, i told you, you're just not right for                            the part.|joey| what do you mean? rach, don't i seem like a professor                            you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
rachel| i'm sorry, this sounds like something i'm never                            gonna be interested in.|chandler| joe...
joey| just watch it, and if you don't like it, you                            don't pass it on to your bosses!|chandler| fine!
joey| thank you. |chandler| work, joe!
joey| damn it! |joey| just pass it to your boss!
chandler| he's not right for the part. so if i suggest                            him, my bosses are gonna think i'm an idiot! and that's                            something they should learn on their own!|rachel| just tell joey that you watched the tape and                            you liked it, but your bosses didn't. then that way,                            you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
chandler| that's good! i liked it, they didn't. .|ross| i can't believe i'm about to meet benjamin hobart.                            i've always thought of him as one of the people i'd                            invite to my fantasy dinner party. do you think there's                            any chance he'll bring christie brinkley or c3po?
charlie|  sorry, looks                            like it's just him.|benjamin| charlie! my god, you look absolutely stunning!
ross| well, i... i am having a good hair day.|benjamin| so good to see you.

benjamin| oh, well, likewise. actually, not likewise.                            i've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's                            nice to be nice! |charlie| shall we? .
benjamin| . i can't                            believe that you chose this restaurant! do you remember                            the night?|charlie| oh my god, i completely forgot! .
ross| no, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image,                            you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with...                            tzz-zzz, mmm.|charlie| ross, why don't you tell benji about your                            proposal, while i go to the ladies room?
benjamin| so, tell me about it.|ross| ok well, i would like to do a dig in the painted                            desert.
benjamin| m-m.|ross| see, there are still several areas that haven't                            been fully excavated.
benjamin| break up with charlie!|ross| what?
benjamin| what?|ross| did you just say \break up with charlie\?
benjamin| well, yes, and now. yes i did say it, and                            no, i didn't not say it.|ross| kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
benjamin| i'm sorry. i just haven't seen her for so                            long! all these feelings are rushing back! i'm starting                            to realize how much i missed her, and i'm gonna need                            you to break up with her.|ross| are you serious?
benjamin| if you say yes then i'm serious, if you say                            no then i'm joking!|ross| no!
benjamin| joking it is!|monica| hey, how did it go with mike, is he gonna let                            you keep the painting?
phoebe| no, he really hates it. but he's gonna let                            me keep my box of human hair! so you got to pick your                            battles. but the good news is, gladys is yours!|monica| wow, what's the bad news!
rachel| who's gladys?|phoebe| oh, she's that work of art i made, you know,                            with the woman coming out of the frame.
rachel| oh, and monica gets to keep her?                            in her house? i am so jealous!|phoebe| oh, i didn't know you wanted her too!
monica| huh!|rachel| well, i mean, sure, of course. but... you already                            gave that to monica, so...
monica| you know, i would give her up, for you.|rachel| no, i couldn't let you do that.
monica| but i want to.|rachel| but i don't want you to.
monica| but i insist!|rachel| but i insist harder!
phoebe| girls, girls, stop, ok? we'll flip a coin.                            heads, she's rachel's, tails she's monica's. . tails! monica, she's yours!|monica| no, that landed in your food!
rachel|  no, no, that's ok. you won fair                            and square. i'm so sad!|joey| what's up?
chandler| bad news. i watched the tape and passed it                            along to my bosses and they weren't interested.|joey|  oh.
chandler|  i'm sorry man.|joey|  but, ehm... you watched                            the tape?
chandler|  but,                            ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. stupid sons of bitches!|joey|  you didn't watch the tape.
chandler|  what!? of course i did!|joey| look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie                            to me?
chandler| i'm not lying to you, i watched it!|joey| well, you lied again! 
chandler| i watched it!|joey| keep going pinocchio!
chandler|                             i did!|joey| 
chandler| |rachel| did you watch the tape?
chandler|                             no!|dr. li| well, i believe that the answers lie in the                            osteological evidence. i plan to begin there.
benjamin|  interesting.|ross|  i guess!
benjamin| dr. biely, your proposal includes some field                            work. where might that take place?|dr. biely| primarily in the pierre shale region of                            south dakota.
benjamin| certainly. very well. and dr. geller, when                            is my birthday?|ross| 
benjamin| care to venture a guess?|ross|  may 12th?
benjamin|  dr.                            li, how many graduate students you'd be needing?|dr. li| half a dozen.
benjamin| i see, and dr. biely?|dr. biely| three for excavation and two for analysis.
benjamin| certainly. dr. geller, which 1965 shirelles                            hit was later covered by a popular british invasion                            band?|ross|  wha..? i need 6 graduate                            students. 
benjamin| no! i'm sorry, we were looking for \baby                            it's you\. baby it's you.|ross| wha...? wait, wait, wait, just a minute. none                            of my questions have anything to do with paleontology.
benjamin| you're right, i apologize. scratch the last                            question. spell \boscodictiasaur\.|ross|  um... i've never heard of a \boscodictiasaur\.
benjamin| yeah, i just made it up. spell it.|ross|  b - o - s ...
benjamin| no, it starts with a silent \m\.|ross| oh come on!!
rachel| but you are a liar.|chandler| what did i just say?
joey| you still here?|chandler| yes, and i have to say, i am not just hurt.                            i am insulted. when i tell somebody i did something...
joey| ok whoah-hey... let me just stop you right there,                            ok? first, you lied, right? then, you lied about lying,                            ok? then you lied about lying about lying, ok? so before                            you lie about lying about lying about lying about...                            lying...  stop                            lying!|chandler| why are you so sure i didn't watch this tape?
joey| |rachel| well, this is going well. 
joey| |chandler| he really is a chameleon.
monica|  oh, my! |rachel| 
rachel| well, hey! how about right above the tv? .                            that way, it will be the first thing that you see when                            you walk in the door!|phoebe|  yeah, yeah! and                            you can get rid of that french poster.
monica|  i like that poster!|phoebe| really? it doesn't have anything coming out                            of it. or maybe there is some place for her in your                            bedroom?
rachel|  oh!                            there's nothing above your bed!!|monica|  are you still here?
scene| ross' office. ross is pacing and benjamin enters]|benjamin| i've come here to apologize. i think i may                            have let my feelings for charlie interfere with the                            interview process. 
ross|  no! stop! |benjamin| anyway, i've decided to offer you the grant.                          
ross|  really?|benjamin| well... there is just one small... stipulation...
ross| i have to break up with charlie?|benjamin| hey, you got one right!
ross| you're crazy.|benjamin| crazy, or... romantic?
ross| crazy!|benjamin| ooor...
ross| |rachel| o-oh my god!
joey|  what?|rachel| joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
joey| i got it from monica. she sold it to me for a                            very reasonable price.|rachel| joey, we're not keeping this!
joey| but it's an original buffay...|rachel| alright, fine. you can keep it. as long as                            you don't mind that she's haunted. 
joey| hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?|rachel| well, legend has it joey, that... she comes                            alive when you're asleep.
rachel| she climbs out of the frame, and then drags                            her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs                            to steal.  and then with her                            one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns                            your doorknob.|joey| get that legless witch out of here!
monica| hey! i sold that to joey.|rachel| well, why i told him it's haunted. two can                            play at this game. 
monica| no, too late. you can't give it back! |rachel| yes i can! 
monica| no you can't. she's yours!|rachel| she's yours!
monica| she's yours!|rachel| she's yours!
phoebe| hey! |rachel| she's mine!
monica| she's m-i-i-ne!|rachel| she's mine!
monica| she's mine!|phoebe| you guys! you guys! you don't have to fight                            over her anymore. 
rachel| i want gladys!|monica| she's mine!
rachel| she's mine!|monica| she's mine!
rachel| she's mine!|scene| rachel and joey's. joey's home alone, reading                            a sports illustrated magazine when chandler enters.]                           chandler: look, i'm sorry i didn't give them your tape.                            and i promise, next time to submit you whether i think                            you are right for the part or not.
joey| that's not the point chandler. the point is that                            you lied.|chandler| i know. you're right. what's it gonna take                            for you to forgive me?
rachel| excellent!|joey| now, what do you say?
chandler| lying is wrong!|joey| and?... and?
chandler| i'm a pretty little girl.|phoebe| i knew it!
charlie| did you get the grant?|ross| no i didn't, and you want to know why? because                            your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
charlie| what?|ross| yeah. he wouldn't give me the grant, because                            i wouldn't give you up.
charlie| benji isn't in love with me. i mean, he broke                            up with me. and besides, he's a very ethical man.|ross| really? is it ethical to ask someone in a grant                            review, who was the voice of \underdog\?
charlie| i'm sure he was just joking, ross.|ross| if you don't believe me, let's go talk to him,                            okay? i'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological                            question.
charlie| seriously?|ross| oh, i'm sorry, no. he did ask me one. uhm...                            how do you spell mboscodictiosaur?
charlie| well, if it's like the lake mbosco in congo,                            then m-b-o... |ross| damnit!
ross| i want you to tell her everything. about the                            deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions                            you... wally cox! that's the voice of underdog!|benjamin| like i tried to tell you in the interview                            ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty                            useless trivia.
ross| no, no, no. don't do that! i want you to look                            her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.|charlie| benji?
benjamin| alright, it's true. i behaved horribly. but                            it's only because i still love you. and i would do anything                            to have you back in my life.|ross| too little, too late, benji!
charlie| i can't believe this.|benjamin| i never should have broken up with you. i                            think about you all the time. i mean, do you ever still                            think about me? 
ross|  no!|charlie| yes!
ross| what?|charlie| i don't know what to say, benji. this is all                            so.... romantic.
ross| or...|benjamin| listen, i know, i may be way out of bounds                            here, but is there any chance you will take me back?
charlie| maybe...|ross| sweetie, this conversation is starting to make                            me a little uncomfortable.
charlie| oh god! i am so sorry, but...  i mean it's... there's so much                            history between us, you know...|benjamin|  i'm                            sorry too...
benjamin| i love you!|charlie| i love you too! 
ross| okay, that's it. we are seeing other people!|joey| gladys?
rachel| ha ha ha, third time this week. man, this does                            not get old.|joey| you're mean!
phoebe| hey!|ross| hey, what are you doing?
mike| oh, figuring out our wedding plans.|chandler| that's funny, we were doing the same thing!
ross| yeah!|phoebe| it's really crazy! the hall, the dress, the                            food... i-i had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
chandler| yeah it is really pricey. i mean, i freaked                            when i first heard the numbers.|phoebe| so what did you two do about it?
chandler| it was pretty simple actually, i came up                            with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a                            list and monica told me to go to hell.|ross| there's no way around it pheebs, you just gonna                            have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you                            a lot of money.
mike| i heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar                            a year industry.|ross| yeah, and i'm responsible for just like half                            of that.
phoebe| but really, it does seem like this money could                            be put to better use?|mike| are you serious?
phoebe| yeah! now, how would you feel if we gave all                            the wedding money to charity and we just got married                            at city hall?|mike| i think it would make me wanna marry you even                            more. 
ross| i've got to say you guys, that's an incredible                            gesture!|chandler|  maybe you do that next time you                            get married!
ross| no, no, no. the next time it's gonna be a hawaii                            at sunset.  but maybe the time after that!|joey| hey!
chandler| hey!|joey| what's going on?
chandler| our adoption social worker is coming by today                            so we are cleaning the apartment.|monica|  we?
chandler| you know you don't want me to help. you can't                            have it both ways!|joey| hey, is this person who decides whether or not                            you... get a baby?
chandler| kind of. she's coming by to interview us                            and see where we live.|monica| and it has to go perfectly, because if she                            doesn't like something about us she can keep us off                            every adoption list in the state.
joey| hey, maybe i should stop by! she could be a soap                            opera fan! it's very impressive when the little people                            know a celebrity.|chandler|  little people?
joey|  celebrity.|monica| ok, so i think i'm just about done here, unless                            you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn                            or cigarettes?
chandler| what...? no!|monica| chandler?
chandler|                             i don't, and i'm offended by the insinuation!|monica| ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch,                            or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet                            tank, or a filthy video in the vcr?
chandler| i'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine,                            but that tape is not mine.|monica| it isn't mine!
joey|  well, i                            guess we'll never know whose it is!|charity guy| may i help you? 
phoebe| yes. we're here to make a rather sizeable donation                            to the children.|charity guy| well, any contribution, large or small,                            is always appreciated.
phoebe| well, i think you're gonna appreciate it the                            crap out of this one |charity guy| well, this is very generous!
phoebe| and we don't want any recognition. this is                            completely anonymous.|mike| completely anonymous. from two kind strangers.
phoebe| mr. x and phoebe buffay.|charity guy| well if you like, we can include your                            names in our newsletter.
mike| not necessary.|phoebe| buffay is spelled b-u-f-f-a-y.

phoebe| oh, look! and we get these free t-shirts! |charity guy| oh, actually, that's the shirt i wore                            to the gym.
phoebe| mhm... it's moist.|ross|  hi!
rachel| hi! emma will be up in a minute!|ross| oh, good!
rachel| oh hey ross... listen, i heard about you and                            charlie. i'm really sorry.|ross| oh, that's ok. i'm sure there are tons of other                            beautiful paleontologists out there.
rachel| absolutely.|ross| there was one! she's it! all the rest look like                            they should live under a bridge!
rachel| so, uhm... what are you gonna do today?|ross| well, i was thinking of taking emma to the playground!
rachel| oh my god, what!?|ross| like i said i was thinking of taking emma to                            the museum of knives and fire!
rachel| ok, look, ross. i do not want emma going to                            the playground.|ross| be-caaauuuse...
rachel|  all right, well, if you must know...                            i had a traumatic... swing incident... when i was little.|ross| seriously?
rachel| yes, i was 4 years old and i was on the swing                            and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the                            chain. and to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a                            big chunk of my hair!  and it was uneven for                            weeks!|ross|  and you made it through that? i wonder                            who's gonna play you in the movie!
rachel| ok, fine! you can make fun of me. i do not                            want emma going there. and i was thinking claire danes.|ross| look, i'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok?                            but the swings are perfectly safe, and besides emma                            loves them. you know what, you should come with us and                            you'll see!
rachel| ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour!                            ok? when you're... and there is that moment when you                            are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna                            return back to earth!|rachel| all right!
ross| good, you dont want to be one of those                            mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their                            children, do you?|rachel| irrational, huh? all right, well, ill                            remember that the next time you freak out about a spider                            in your apartment!
ross| oh, yeah, thats the same, i am sure there                            are thirty different species of poisonous swings!|monica| oh my god, the adoption lady is early! 
chandler| ok, ok, here we go.|monica| ok.

monica| thats crazy! .                            i am sorry. i just cant imagine giving up my                            one wedding day like that!|phoebe| we, you know, were different! we dont                            care about having a huge party.  all right, well, who cares, i dont need                            a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
monica| thats right. youre making a commitment                            and thats the same, whether you do that at the                            plaza or, where are you gonna do it?|phoebe| city hall.
monica| ow!  oh, that                            sounds nice! i am just there for jury duty. they really                            spruce that place up!|phoebe| its ok, its ok. i made my decision.                            what i really want is a great big wedding 
monica| yay!|chandler| but you already gave all your money to charity!
phoebe| well, ill just ask for it back!|chandler| i dont think you can do that!
monica| why not! this is her wedding day, this is way                            more important than some stupid kids!|chandler| thats sweet, honey, but save something                            for the adoption lady.
rachel| ok, careful.|ross| ok.
rachel| careful, watch her hair. watch her hair!|ross| rach, shes got like three hairs!

ross| oh, absolutely!|rachel| ok. oh god.  get the camera, its                            in the diaper bag.
ross| ok!  ow!|mike| were seriously asking for our money back?
phoebe| its for our wedding day! right, now,                            is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna                            have to start flirting.|charity guy| wow! are you here to make another donation                            the same day? i dont think that thats                            ever happened before.
phoebe| the donation we made earlier, we k,                            we w, we want it back.|charity guy| excuse me?
phoebe| yeah. see, that money was for a big wedding,                            that we thought we didnt want, but it turns out                            we do.|charity guy| so youre asking us to refund your                            donation to the children?
mike| yeah! this feels really good.|phoebe| i am sorry. i am, but this wedding is just                            really important to me.
charity guy| hey, its not my business,  besides its probably                            a good thing. we really would have been spoiling the                            children, all those food, and warm clothing|phoebe| hey, thats not fair! a persons                            wedding is important! and especially to me! ok? i didnt                            have a graduation party! and i didnt go to prom.                            and i spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire                            yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words                            wanted to kill me or whatever. so i deserve                            a real celebration and i am not gonna let some sweaty                            little man make me feel badly about it.
mike| she could have been talking about either one                            of us.|laura| hi, i am laura, i am here for your adoption                            interview.

monica| ok. great. i am so glad that you are here.                            were really excited about getting this process                            started.|chandler| oh, because we love kids. love em                            to death.well, not actually to death, that's just a                            figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount...                            as allowed by law.
laura| your place is just lovely.|monica| ah, thank you. this building does have a wholesome                            family feel to it.
laura| you know, i... i feel like i've been here before.                            are any other couples in the                            building adopting?|monica| is that that couple on the first floor? because                            we should get a baby before                            them. yeah! that guy tried to sell me drugs. 
chandler| but other than that... wholesome, wholesome                            building.|laura| oh...
chandler| what?|laura| i just realized why i remember this place.
monica| really? what is it?|laura| oh, it's nothing. i went on a date with a guy                            who lived in this building and it                            didn't end very well.
monica| ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... joey                            tribbiani?|laura| yes!
chandler| of course it was!|laura| yeah, we had a really great night and in the                            morning he promised he would call                            me and he didn't.
chandler| rat bastard!|laura| so you're not friends with him?
monica and chandler| oh god no! nope, no, no, no. no!                            no, no. nope! no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. no!                             no!|laura| well, i'm sorry i brought it up. so, are either                            one of you planning on staying at                            home with your child... 
joey|  ow!|laura| what was that?
chandler| oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the                            halls here. he's great with                            kids though.|rachel| oh, oh ross, oh my god, are you okay?
ross| son of a bitch! |rachel| ross, see! i told you, those swings are evil!                            alright, that is it. that is                            the last time emma is getting on one of those things                            for her entire life.
ross| no! no, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's                            fault. it was my fault and kind                            of that  kids fault.                            who is still laughing. nice. |rachel| ross, c'mon, please. can we just get out of                            here, before somebody else gets                            hurt?
ross| no wait, okay, okay, i have an idea. i want you                            to get on the swing, okay? and                            you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of. |rachel|  i know what this                            is all about... you've always been                            jealous of my hair.
ross| look, i just think you're an adult, okay? and                            you should get over your silly                            fears.|rachel| alright fine. i'll do it.
ross| good.|rachel| if you hold a spider. 
ross|  what? where? where?|rachel| if you hold a spider.

monica| keep on roaming bert! we don't want any crazy                            today!|joey| what's going on?
chandler| we'll talk to you later, bert. everythng's                            fine!! |joey| everything doesn't sound fine!
laura| is he alright out there by himself?|chandler| oh yeah! he has a caretaker. his older brother...                            ernie.
laura| bert and ernie!|chandler|  you can't make this stuff                            up!
mike| you never told me about that guy on your sweet                            sixteen. oh, ugh. i'm sorry about                            that.|phoebe|  oh! it ended okay. one of my friends                            shot him. 
mike| well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding.                            i mean, you really deserve that.|phoebe| yeah, i really do. you know, i had nothing                            growing up.  just like the kids i took the money from.
mike| no! no, no. i see where this is going. don't                            make me go back there.|phoebe| look, i can't have a wedding with this money                            now. it's tainted.
mike| alright, fine. we'll give the money back.|phoebe| and if that guy at the charity gives us a hard                            time, my friend hasn't shot                            anyone in a really long time.
laura| well, i must say, this seems like a lovely environment                            to raise a child in.|monica| oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to                            look under any of the furniture,                            because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes                            under there!
laura| oh! well, actually, before we look around, let                            me make sure i have everything i need                            up to here...|monica|  why don't                            i show you the baby's room?
chandler| what the hell are you doing?|joey| well, you wouldn't let me in, so i thought you                            were in trouble.
chandler| well, we're not.|joey| but you called me 'bert'!? that's our code word                            for danger!
chandler| we don't have a code word.|joey| we don't? we really should. from now on, 'bert'                            will be our code word for danger.
monica| so that was the baby's room. |monica|  what room should we see next?
chandler| any room that isn't behind this couch! |monica| .
joey|  i did not care for that!|chandler|  you have to                            get out of here. you slept with                            our social worker and you never called her back and                            she is still pissed, so she can't                            see you.
joey| ok, ok! |chandler| ok!
chandler| what?|joey| i forgot my bat.
laura| oh my god!|chandler| and for the last time, we do not want to                            be friends with you! and we don't want to buy your bat!                            
laura| what are you doing here?|joey|  bert! bert! bert! bert!
laura| are you friends with him?|chandler| i can explain... joey...
joey| uhm... ok... uhm... well, yeah... you have got                            some nerve, coming back here. i can't believe you never                            called me.|laura| excuse me?
joey| oh... yeah... probably you don't even remember                            my name. it's joey, by the way. and don't bother telling                            me yours, because i totally remember it... lady. yeah!                            i waited weeks for you to call me.|laura| i gave you my number, you never called me.
joey| no, no! don't try to turn this around on me,                            ok? i'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you                            can just... do.|laura|  well,                            i'm pretty sure i gave you my number.
joey| really? think about it. come on! you're a beautiful                            woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh?                            if i had your number, why wouldn't i call you?|laura| i don't know... well, maybe i'm wrong... i'm                            sorry...
joey| no, no, hey, no! too late for apologies... ok?                            you broke my heart. you know how many women i had to                            sleep with to get over you? |laura| joey, wait!
joey| |laura|  i'm sorry that you had                            to see that. i'm so embarrassed...
chandler| oh, that's really ok.|monica| yeah, that we totally understand. dating is                            hard.
laura| boy, you people are nice... and i've got to                            say... i think you're going to make excellent parents.|joey| laura! 
phoebe|  we're back!|charity guy| are you here to take more money? because,                            i think what you're looking for is an atm.
mike| no, no, we're here to give the money back.|phoebe| yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all                            about the children. 
phoebe| although... it's also about the wedding...                            ugh, alright... here.  no... oh god... oh!|charity guy| if i haven't said so already sir,  congratulations!
mike|  now... what do you think we should                            do?|charity guy| you know what? it's not your decision                            anymore.
mike| what?|charity guy| on behalf of the children of new york,                            i reject your money.
phoebe| but... but... but we're giving you this!|charity guy| yeah... and i'm giving it back to you...                            come on! consider it a contribution. 
phoebe|                             well, this is very generous!|charity guy| please, take the check, go have a great                            wedding and a wonderful life together.
mike| well, i mean... it sounds good to me. and that                            way we can save up, come back in a few years and make                            an even bigger donation.|charity guy| absolutely! and when you do, make sure                            you ask for brian.
phoebe| oh, is that you?|charity guy| no!
monica| hello...? oh hi... oh my god...! really...?                            i can't wait to tell chandler... ok, goodbye. |chandler| wrong number?
monica| it was laura... she gave us a great report                            and we are officially on the waiting list.|chandler| that's great!
monica| now we just have to wait for a call and...                            and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us.                            oh... |chandler| hello...? have you seen joey's bat?
rachel| ok... i got a spider. there were two, i picked                            the bigger one.|ross|  ok...
rachel| ok... |ross|  this feels                            perfectly normal. ok, get on the swing!
rachel|  ok... o-k...|rachel|  ok...
rachel| whoo... ok... wow... ok... oh!|ross| see?
rachel| a-alright! i can do this.|ross| there you go! good for you! and you know what,                            i'm actually getting used to this little guy. i don't                            really even feel him in here anymore.
rachel| that's because he's on your neck.|ross| well...  whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
rachel| hi! |phoebe| hey!
monica| we need to talk to you about something.|chandler| yeah. we don't feel like we can host thanksgiving                            this year.
all| what?|phoebe| hey!
ross| are you kidding?|chandler| well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress                            of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy.                            plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden                            falls on us. 
ross|  that doesn't sound like you... that's                            monica talking!|chandler| no, no! we made this decision together. 
ross| she's putting words in your mouth!|joey| don't you put words in people's mouths, you put                            turkey in people's mouths!
rachel| i can't believe this! this is emma's first                            thanksgiving!|monica| no, it's not!
rachel| it's not?  when was she                            born?|phoebe| well, personally i think it's great you're                            giving yourself a break.
monica| thank you, pheebs!|phoebe| sure. it's just as well... i mean, last year                            wasn't very good. i think she's losing her touch.
monica| what? you are way off, lady!|phoebe| am i? really? am i? well, why don't you cook                            thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! well, think                            about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than                            you did last year. you'd be in competition... with yourself.
monica| that's my favourite kind! okay, we are doing                            this!|chandler| don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
monica| hey, stay out of this, chandler! this is between                            me... and me!|chandler| we are supposed to make these decisions together!                            did you not watch the doctor phil i taped for you?
phoebe| hey!|rachel| hi! happy thanksgiving!
phoebe| oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.|monica| you guys, i ordered some chocolate pies from                            that bakery on bleecker. could you pick them up for                            me?
phoebe| you're not making the pies yourself?|monica| no, no, no, i don't make chocolate pies. when                            i was younger i-i enter in this pie-eating contest.                            i ate so many that just the thought of them made me                            sick.
rachel| did you at least win the contest?|monica| 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! okay,                            i see you guys at 4.
rachel| can't wait!|monica| this dinner is gonna be so great! in your face,                            last year \me\!
phoebe| hey rach.|rachel| yeah.
phoebe| what's emma doing today?|rachel| well, let's see... uh... i know that she has                            a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a                            very big poop. why?
phoebe| well, i wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.|rachel| oh my god! that's the creepiest thing i've                            ever heard!
phoebe| okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend                            susanne is entering her kid and compared to emma she's                            a real dog!|rachel| oh! phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
phoebe|  oh... okay. |rachel| phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against                            another, i mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just                            for a trophy... 
rachel| and a thousand dollars.|rachel| ...is something i'm very interested in! oh                            please, do not tell ross. he still believes that  what's in the inside is                            important...
phoebe| okay, oh, and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for                            the competition.|rachel| where am i gonna get a cowgirl outfit on thanksgiving?
phoebe| well, i was thinking...|rachel| oh, take the clothes of joey's cabbage patch                            kid. 
phoebe| yeah!|monica|  did someone drop the                            baton again?
chandler| why come all the way from kansas to do that?|monica|  i don't get                            older. i just get better!
chandler| you know what just occurred to me? this could                            be our last thanksgiving just the two of us. i mean,                            we could be getting a baby soon!|monica| you don't know that.
chandler| somebody is gonna pick us. |monica| yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the                            adoption agency and it has been weeks!
chandler| i'm telling ya! it's gonna happen. next year                            it's gonna be you, me and the little hemingway bing.                             what, he's my favourite author!|monica| name one of his books.
chandler|  \the firm\?|monica| ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in                            the oven, the stuffing is ready...
chandler| you know, you always cook this meal all by                            yourself. let me help this year. |monica| oh, chandler, that's sweet. but you don't have                            to do everything doctor phil tells you to do.
chandler| i'm serious, let me do something, just not                            the turkey or the stuffing, nothing \high profile\.|monica| ok, let's see... oh, the cranberry sauce, it                            is easy to make and no-one really cares about it. 
chandler| tell me more.|monica| okay, i'm gonna go check on something across                            the hall. you start by washing these 
chandler| you obviously haven't tasted my palmolive                            potatoes!|ross| hey! hey, guess what joey has!
joey| three tickets to today's rangers game!!|ross| dude, i wanted him to guess.
joey| oh.|chandler| oh my god!
joey| yeah, they're great seats too!|ross| guess where they are?
joey| center ice.|ross| did i do something to you?
chandler| hmm, the game's at one.|ross| so? 
chandler| dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make                            it back.|joey| so we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back                            in time.
chandler| you say that now, but it could take us a                            long time to get back home. plus joey could get lost                            and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.|joey| dude, two times that happened!
chandler| look, monica has been working hard all day,                            she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place,                            we shouldn't go!|ross| he's right, man.
joey| right, i guess. alright, so see you at four.                          |chandler| okay.  and get ready to taste my very                            special cranberries. or should i say... chanberries!
joey| that's some gentle comedy, dude. |ross| we're still going at the game, right?
joey| yeah!|ross| yeah.
host| this is contestant number sixteen, rebecca...|phoebe| hey.
rachel| oh phoebe, listen. well, i think we gotta go.                            this place is really freaking me out. i've been watching                            this guy over there, i don't think he came with a kid!|phoebe| we can't leave now! there was this one baby,                            haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so                            she had to stay home! this competition just blew wide                            open, folks!
rachel| phoebe, i think... it's just too weird, i just                            saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!|phoebe| oh, i know, we should have been more prepared.                             it's okay. now, the way i see it,                            our real competition now is cameron. oh my god, they                            just took her sweater off. look at those arms! hello                            michelin man.
rachel| oh, phoebe! come on! you know what, it's already                            three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to emma's                            group yet. we gotta go, we got dinner!|phoebe|  but emma's got what it takes, she                            could go all the way! 
rachel| phoebe, you have to calm down.|phoebe| okay. rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state                            area are in this room right now! i overheard one of                            the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to                            emma!
rachel| really?|phoebe| yeah!
rachel| you heard them say that?|phoebe| yeah!
rachel| all right, okay. alright, let's give to these                            babies something to cry about!|phoebe| good! oh yay! let's get down to business! emma                            needs some makeup!
rachel| no, what?|phoebe| well, she's gonna look all washed out next                            to the other contestants!
rachel| no phoebe, i am not letting you put makeup                            on my baby!|phoebe| why not!
rachel| because i already did! |joey| oh, bob, get off the guy!
ross| oh! what a game, huh?|joey| i know, yeah.
ross| i can't believe chandler is missing this!|joey| yeah. i am sorry he's not here too, but i got                            to say,  i am really enjoying                            nacho chair.
ross| yeah, i'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't                            keep batting my hand away.|joey| ohhhh! these seats are great!
ross| i know, i know! when i was here for holidays                            on ice  i was sitting so far away michelle kwan couldn't                            read my banner!|joey|  wow, hey, we'd better get                            going. if we don't leave right now, we'll be late for                            dinner.
ross| oh, but it's a kind game! so we're a little late,                            you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for                            one more goal.|joey| i don't know...
ross| one more fight!|joey| okay.
ross| okay.|monica| where is everybody? they're forty-five minutes                            late!
chandler| i can't believe they are not here! i slave                            and i slave for what? they've ruined cranberry day!|joey| how late are we?
ross| forty-five minutes.|joey| wow 
ross|  here!|joey| okay. rachel and phoebe are already there, okay?                            so they probably started without us. we could just slip                            in and no-one needs to know where we were! 
ross| you may want to lose the foam finger!|joey| oh, no, no, no, no, no. you just want to put                            it on your hand!
ross| hey!|phoebe| oh!
joey| you are not at thanksgiving?|rachel| no... 
phoebe| no, we're late!|rachel| what are you doing here!

joey|  oh! that's alicia mae emory's outfit!|phoebe| you guys, there are people in there who are                            not getting any happier!

monica|  oooh! they are in for a world of pain!|chandler|  ross'                            shirt is torn.
monica| oh! they're late and they're sloppy!|rachel| alright, emma is napping...                             what happened to your shirt?
ross| i got mugged. and they stole my pocket.|phoebe| we're just... we're trying to figure out an                            excuse. hey! ooh! how about this: we can say that monica                            told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. that way we're right                            on time!  or...                            or, we can plant pcp in the apartment and call the cops                            on her.
ross|  that would be a good way to get rid                            of all the pcp we have lying around.|rachel| you know what, we just say that she said it                            was 5 o'clock. we'll just act casual. we're not late,                            we're right on time. 
ross| |joey|  who do you think its from?
rachel| oh, god. this is bad. this is so bad.|ross| well, let's just go in there and face them.
phoebe| well, i'm not going in first. i bet that vein                            on monica's forehead is popping like crazy. |joey| i hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
rachel| oh, hey, i have an idea. why don't we play                            rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first.                            .|joey|  ah-haah! i win!!
ross| what is that? |joey| that's fire. beats everything.
phoebe| oh, really? does it beat water balloon? .                          |joey| ooh! well played, phoebe buffay, well played.                          
rachel| alright, enough, enough, come on. let's just                            all go in at the same time.|all| alright, okay. 
phoebe| it's locked.|ross| wha...? oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're                            having sex on the couch, its like: \come on in,                            my butt is surprisingly hairy\. 
rachel| alright, come on...  alright, you guys. we're so sorry we're late.                            please let us in, so we can have dinner together.|monica| no! everything's cold. the turkey's dried out                            and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
chandler| yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce                            that...  what happens to cranberry                            sauce?|monica|  nothing. it's fine.
chandler|  oh thank god!|ross| come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? our subway                            broke down.
chandler|  that's a lie,                            you went to the game, i can see joey's hand.|ross| 
rachel| you guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're                            late. we're all here now, please let us in so we can                            have some of your delicious turkey. |joey| i had a dream once about a fax machine that did                            that. 
monica| that's all the turkey you're gonna get.|ross| how are we gonna decide who gets this?
joey| |phoebe| what are we gonna do? i'm starving.
rachel|  oh, i just remembered. we do have something                            to eat. monica put something in our oven this morning.|phoebe| oh yeah!
monica| hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.|chandler| guys, i'd listen to her. the vein is bigger                            than i've ever seen it. 
rachel| huh... oh my god it's brussels sprouts. |ross| that's worse than no food.
chandler| ha-ha! all you got was monica's stinky brussels                            sprouts!|monica| stinky?!
chandler| please let me stay on this side of the door.|rachel| oh, i know... i still have my old key!  we can                            just unlock the door.
phoebe| well, i don't know if that's such a good idea.                            they clearly don't want to be with us.|rachel| you know what? i don't want to be with them                            either, but it's thanksgiving and we should not want                            to be together, together. 
joey|  just get in there and make a face to                            face apology, you know? look them in the eye. i know                            i can get them to forgive us.|ross| i don't know...
joey| i'm telling ya...  i can do it.|ross|  yeah, he can do it!
rachel| oh!|joey| oh! it all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the                            stuffing...
chandler| the cranberries...?|monica| oh! enough! a monkey could have made 'em!
joey|  hey listen                            guys, we feel really terrible.|chandler| he's doing that weird eye contact thing.                            don't look at him, don't look at him! 
joey| come on you guys, we want you to know we're  right guys?|ross| i feel terrible.
phoebe and rachel| so, so sorry.|joey|  now let's not ruin this day. you worked                            so hard. let's move past this and try to have a nice                            meal all together, huh?
chandler| the floating heads do make a good point.|monica| yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
rachel| so bad.|ross | so bad.
phoebe| so bad.|monica|  go get the dessert. and i'll let you in. 
rachel| dessert?|monica| yeah, i asked you and phoebe to pick up the                            pies. you did remember, right?
phoebe| pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize .|monica| grand supreme little darling?
rachel| congratulatioooons!|monica| oh my god! you forgot the pies? well, i cannot                            believe this. you force me to make dinner, then you're                            an hour late and you forget the one little thing that                            i asked you to do.
ross| really girls, not cool.|chandler| well, you manheads aren't any better. you                            lied about going to the game. you knew it would make                            you late, and you still went anyway.
joey| hey! i'm getting a little tired of this okay?                            we said we're sorry. it's thanksgiving for pete's sakes!                            a day of forgiveness!|ross| it's a day to be thankful.
joey|  don't make me come up there!|monica| it's too late for apologies.
joey| fine! let's just go. i don't need your stupid                            dinner.|chandler| that would be a lot more convincing if you                            weren't drooling.
rachel| ewww, is that what that is?|joey| sorry!
phoebe| come on you guys, let's just do our own thanksgiving.|rachel| yeah! i'll cook!
ross| yeah! let's go out.|rachel| hey!
joey| yeah! you three have a nice thanksgiving.|monica| the three of us?
joey| yeah! you, chan, and the vein!|joey| ha!
joey| oh-oh! i'm stuck!|monica| joey, that is not gonna work.
joey| no seriously... i'm really wedged in here.|phoebe| i'll pull you through.
ross| okay.|joey|  aaw-ahhh-aaahhh stop! stop! i'm worried                            about damaging my head.
chandler| a little late for that.|joey| alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
monica| alright, well, this does not change anything.                             okay, we need to get something to grease                            the sides of his face.|chandler| uhm, we've got turkey grease.
monica| bring it.|joey| i just wanna say that i'm sorry i referred to                            the vein as a seperate person...
monica| here you go!|joey| oh, that smells good!
joey| okay.|monica| okay, try it.
joey| it isn't working.|monica| alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
joey| well hurry, i can't feel my ears!|chandler| can you ever feel your ears?
joey| interesting...|monica| chandler, where are your tools?
chandler|  oh, i left them on my bulldozer...                            i don't have tools!|monica| i do, but rachel borrowed them.
rachel| i lent them to ross.|ross| i gave them to joey.
joey| i left them at the park.|monica| oh!
ross|  i'm finding it really                            hard not to mess with him.|phoebe| i've already stuffed a bunch of brussel sprouts                            down his pants.
ross| nice!|monica| okay, i have to get that. now when i get back,                            i want you and your friends to be gone. thanksgiving                            is over. the vein has spoken.
joey| it's really starting to hurt.|chandler| okay, look, i'm gonna pull on the door and                            you guys push as hard as you can. maybe we can get enough                            room to wiggle him out, okay? okay, so push!
phoebe| just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something                            here.|joey| ooh! stop putting things down my pants!
chandler| come on guys, push!|joey| yeah! come on!
joey and chandler| push! push! push!|chandler| my cranberries!
joey|  man, i've got food all over                            me.|chandler| argh! i can't believe what you did. monica's                            gonna kill you!
chandler|  look! look! look what the...                            look what... look what the floating heads did!|monica|  i don't care.
chandler| what's going on?|monica| that was the adoption agency...
chandler| and?|monica| we're getting a baby!
chandler| are you serious? |monica| there's a pregnant woman in ohio, and she picked                            us!
rachel| i'm so happy for you!|monica| this thanksgiving kicks last thanksgiving's                            ass!
rachel| to monica and chandler... and that knocked                            up girl in ohio.|ross| i'm just so happy you guys are finally getting                            a kid.
phoebe| i know. have you considered pageanting?|monica| i can't believe they called, and we're actually                            getting a baby. 
joey| oh, i know how you feel...|rachel| really?
joey| sure. i went through the exact same thing with                            alicia mae emory... the waiting, the wandering... then                            one day... i get that call from toys \r\ us...                            she was in stock!|chandler| that is the exact same thing.
chandler| hi!|ross| hey!
monica| hey!|chandler| we're just here to say goodbye, we're off                            to ohio.
phoebe| oh, right! your adoption interview!|monica| yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be                            carrying our baby.
joey| i can't believe it. when you guys come back,                            you're gonna have a baby! that is so weird!|chandler| and so incorrect!
monica| she's only a couple of months pregnant. she                            liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like                            us.|ross| come on, she's gonna love you guys!
chandler| uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not                            to get our hopes up.|monica| and a lot could still get in our way.
chandler| yeah. i mean, this girl could decide against                            adoption or she could like another couple better..|phoebe| what are you gonna name the baby?
chandler| i can develop a condition in which i talk                            and talk and no one hears a word.|joey| but just think, ok? what if everything goes right?                            what if this woman does pick you guys?
monica| oh my god. she's gonna pick us!|chandler| so we're standing firm on the 'not getting                            our hopes up'?
monica| you know, i know that things could still go                            wrong but if they don't? if this works out, we're gonna                            have a baby chandler, a baby!|chandler| yes, but...
monica| oh my god, it's gonna work! we're gonna make                            it work! i'm gonna be a mummy and |chandler| oh, screw it, i'm gonna be a daddy!!
joey| i'm gonna say someone i'm gonna have sex with.                             hey!|phoebe| hey!
joey| so... who's your friend?|phoebe| oh, that's sarah. no, no. don't you get any                            ideas, ok? no, i'm not setting you up with any more                            of my friends!
joey| ow, why, why, why?|phoebe| because you'll date her once, sleep with her                            and then forget she exists!
joey| oh, name one friend of yours that i did that                            with.|phoebe| mandy.
joey| mandy, uh? uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?|phoebe| no.
joey| i know why i don't remember her, huh? |rachel| do you think i'm someone else?
joey| ok, i may not have treated your friends well                            in the past, but i have grown up a lot, really. honest,                            rach?|rachel| well, believe it or not, it's true. when joey                            and i were together, he was wonderful. he was thoughtful                            and mature. and for the one week that we went out, he                            didn't sleep with anybody else!
joey|  growth!|phoebe| fine, i'll give you her number.
joey| ok, thank you. and i promise you i will not forget                            this one.  mandy.|phoebe| sarah!

erica| you're kidding me? i mean, it's enough that                            you are a doctor. but on top of it, you're married to                            a reverend?|chandler|  i don't think that's exactly...

rachel| oh no! not me! emma!|joey|  joey doesnt                            share food!

ross| so, youre saying, uh, if i wear these                            pants i might be getting into hers?|rachel|  why do men keep talking to me like                            this?
erica| yeah, i read some great applications, but then                            i thought who better then a minister to raise                            a child!|monica| amen.
chandler| plus i thought the baby would be in good                            hands with a doctor!|monica| uh, good hands.                             healing hands.
erica| reverend, can i ask? does the bible say anything                            about adoption?|monica| it says \do it!\ and behold she did                            adopt unto them a baby. and it was good.
erica| wow.|chandler| yeah, wow.
erica| i was wondering you both have such serious jobs.                             would you have time to take care of a baby                            and your flock?|monica| oh, you know, my flock is good, i mean, yeah,                            my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this                            point. good flock. flock, flock, flock.
erica|  being a doctor must take up a                            lot of time.|chandler| not for me it doesnt.
agency guy| so, hows everything going in here?|erica| were great, i think i may have asked                            all my questions.
agency guy| do you have any question for erica?|chandler| yeah, actually. so, you read a file that                            you liked and you gave the agency the serial number                            and they contacted us?
agency guy| yes, our system assures total anonymity.                            were very proud of it.|chandler| you should be. youre really on top                            of stuff..
agency guy|  well, then if theres                            nothing else, then the two of us should talk.|erica| actually, i dont think we have to.
monica| we dont?|erica| yeah, when i read about you two, i was pretty                            sure i wanted you, but i just thought we should meet                            face to face. . i've made my decision.                            i choose them.
monica| oh my god, this is great! this is so great!                            . did you hear that?|chandler| yeah, i did.
monica| . you are so going to heaven!|rachel| we got some really great stuff!
phoebe| yeah, yeah but i am not sure about some of                            the bra's i got.|rachel| oh! really? do you wanna try some of them on                            for me? 
phoebe| oh! okay. wait, are we in joey's imagination?|rachel|  oh                            no! i took one of ross' bags by                            mistake, and one of mine is missing.
phoebe| oh, well, ross probably has it, you can get                            it from him later.|ross| 
joey| i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!|ross|  yeah! yeah! rachel picked it                            out for me. she told me to trust her and you know what?                            i'm glad i did! i turned quite a few heads on my way                            over here.
joey|  dude, i really don't                            think you should be wearing that.|ross| oh, i see, somebody is afraid of a little competition                            with the ladies?
joey|  looks like someone                            is the ladies!!|ross| you're just jealous because you couldn't pull                            this off. yeah, now if you'll excuse me                             all eyes on me!
monica| why not?|chandler| it's wrong. they made a mistake. they think                            we're somebody else.
monica| god works in mysterious ways.|chandler| you have gotta stop!
monica| but she liked us.|chandler| she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica.
monica| well, if you think about it, i am kind of like                            a reverend. i mean, as a chef, i serve god, by feeing                            the hungry and poor. |chandler| your veal chop is $34.95!
monica| c'mon chandler, i think we have been given                            an opportunity. i mean, the mistake has already been                            made. they are writing up the paper right now.|chandler| but we are not the one she chose! how can                            you feel okay about this?
monica|  because... we may not be who                            she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby                            more than us.|chandler| i know..
monica| i mean, who knows how long it's gonna take                            for someone else to give us a baby? what if, what if                            no one ever picks us?|chandler| oh, honey..
monica|  please.. please, we are so                            close.|chandler| monica, i want a baby too, but this woman                            is giving away her child. she deserves to know who it's                            going to. 
monica| |chandler| so, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe                            she'll like us for us.
monica|  maybe she will. uh! why couldn't                            i have been a reverend?|chandler| you're jewish.
monica| technicality!|joey| oh, that looks great! good ordering!
waiter| seafood platter for the gentleman and extra                            fries. enjoy!|sarah| mmmh, those fries look delicious.
joey| oh, i didn't know you liked french fries. help                            yourself! what's mine is yours. |sarah|  oh wow, are those                            stuffed clams?
joey| uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.|joey| how about those fries though, huh? 
sarah| they are delicious |joey|  you are beautiful, you know that?
sarah| oh, that is so sweet..|joey| oh 
joey|  now look what you did!!|sarah| what? what is the matter with you?
joey| i don't like it when people take food off of                            my plate, okay?|sarah| but you just said \what's mine is yours\?
joey| well, i didn't mean it!|sarah| fine, i'm sorry, i didn't think it was that                            big a deal.
joey| i'm sorry, i'm overreacting. okay, it's just                            when it comes to food, i have certain rules, okay, i                            mean .                          |girl| wow, this place looks great.
ross| oh! you are gonna love it!  and                            i'm so glad, we're finally doing this.|girl| me too! 
ross| here |sarah| sure  just not as much as clams.
joey|  well, stuffed clams.|waiter| chocolate torte for the lady, cheesecake for                            the gentleman.
joey| uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort                            of red crap on my cheesecake.|waiter| yes, that's raspberry coule.
joey| |sarah| 
joey| oh, all right, i'll just have what she's having                            instead.|waiter| oh, i'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.
sarah| mmmm! mmm!|sarah| oh, no! this is work. i should call in. can                            you excuse me?
joey| oh yeah, sure. no problem.|sarah| what are you doing? i thought you don't share                            food.
joey| sure i do.  coule?|sarah|  no. if i can't have your clams, you                            can't have my dessert. this is a two way street.
joey|  really?|sarah| really! now this all better be here when i come                            back. 
joey| yeah, of course. i can control myself. |joey|  stop staring at me!
joey| why, just a tiny little...|joey| oh-oh!
joey| i'm not even sorry.|adoption agency guy| hey.
chandler| hey.|agency guy| so, these are the preliminary forms for                            an open adoption. there's a lot to go over, but i'll                            explain everything as we go through it.
monica|  i-is...                            is that a picture?|erica| yeah. it's a sonogram they took of the baby                            last week. i thought you might want to see it. 
monica| look, doctor!|agency guy| i don't understand.
chandler| the agency must have made some mistake. my                            wife is not a reverend and i'm not a doctor.|erica| what?
agency guy| that's impossible.|chandler| i could perform an operation on you and prove                            it if you'd like.
agency guy| i'll go check your file. excuse me.|erica| so who are you?
chandler| well, our names really are monica and chandler.                            we're from new york.|monica| yeah, but the important thing to know about                            us, is how much we would care for this little baby.                            
erica| so you lied to me before?|monica| well, we...                             \bore false witness\... see i could be a reverend.
erica| i can't believe this. |monica| but we were hoping that since we told you the                            truth that you still might consider...
erica| giving you my baby? you think i'd give you my                            child after this?|monica| well, you don't have to decide right now, but                            if you could just look at our file...
erica| i don't want to look at your file! this is over.|chandler| erica wait!
erica| i've nothing to say to you. |chandler| you have every reason to be upset. we did                            lie. but only because we've been waiting and trying                            to have a baby for so long. now we don't know how long                            it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
erica| why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?|chandler| erica, please. just consider us. ask them                            to see our file. our last name's bing. my wife's a chef                            and i'm in advertising.
erica| oh yeah. i actually liked you guys. but it doesn't                            matter, because what you did was wrong. |chandler| but you did like us. and you should. my wife's                            an incredible woman. she's loving and devoted and caring.                            and don't tell her i said this but the woman's always                            right... i love my wife more than anything in this world.                            and i... it kills me that i can't give her a baby...                            i really want a kid. and when that day finally comes,                            i'll learn how to be a good dad. but my wife... she's                            already there. she's a mother... without a baby... please?
chandler| you still want that baby?|monica| god bless you chandler bing!
joey|  so, why are you still wearing it?|ross| because it's soft... hey, so how was your date?
joey| ooh... not so good.|ross| well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight,                            huh old buddy?
joey| yeah, and you know what? we could do a lot worse.|joey|  joey doesn't share food!
rachel| my god, get a room!|monica| i would get a room with this cake. i think                            i could show this cake a good time!
phoebe| if you had to, what would you give up, food                            or sex?|monica|  sex!
chandler|  seriously, answer faster!|monica| oh, i'm sorry honey, you know, but when she                            said \sex\ i wasn't thinking about \sex                            with you\!
chandler|  it's like a giant hug.|phoebe| ross, how about you. what would you give up,                            sex or food?
ross| food.|phoebe| ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
ross| oh my god. it's like sophie's choice.|rachel| oh god. what about you, joe? what would you                            give up, sex or food?
joey| uhm... oh... i don't know, it's too hard.|rachel| no, you gotta pick one!
joey| oh... food. no, sex. food! sex! food! se-i don't                            know! good god, i don't know, i want girls on bread!|phoebe| oh, how cute!
rachel| yeah.|phoebe| oh, she looks just like a little doll!
rachel| oh, no, no. that is a doll.|phoebe| oh, thank god, 'cause that thing's really creepy!                            
rachel| oh. who is the blonde, she's pretty.|phoebe| oh! he's having an affair.
rachel| he's not having an affair!|phoebe| you know, i'm always right about these things.
rachel| no, you're not! last week you thought ross                            was trying to kill you!|phoebe| well, i'm sorry but it's hard to believe that                            anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!                             see, there's something going on with                            them. look, he's getting into the car with her!
rachel| oh, that doesn't mean anything.|phoebe| oh yeah? well, let's see.

chandler| those are all really old!|phoebe| ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...

monica| hey! you smell like perfume and cigarettes.                          |chandler| i was in the car with nancy all day.
monica| nancy doesnt smoke!|chandler| well, at least the perfume is not mine, be                            thankful for that!
monica| so? what do you think of the house?|chandler| its perfect. its everything                            weve been looking for.
monica| isnt it? then what about the amazing                            wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows                            in the attic? |chandler| and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?                             what were the things you said?
monica| dont you love the huge yard?|chandler| and the fireplace in the bedroom.
monica| and nancy said that it's really under price,                            because the guy lost his job and has to move in with                            his parents!|chandler| this is bringing out a lovely color in you!
monica| so? do you think we should get it?|chandler| i dont know. what do you think?

monica| oh my god! oh my god thats awful! what                            did you think of the house?|phoebe| what?
joey|  monica, you understand what we are saying, right?|monica| yeah, sure... uhm, i'm devastated, obviously...                            
chandler| hey!|joey|  you son of a bitch!
chandler| is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill                            around here?|monica|  phoebe and rachel saw you                            with nancy today and... em... they think you're having                            an affair.
rachel| who's nancy?|ross| what's going on?
monica|  ok, alright, you guys, you'd                            better sit down, this is pretty big.|chandler| yeah  i'm                            not having an affair. nancy is our realtor.
joey| i knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!|phoebe| why do you have a realtor?
monica| uhm, she has been showing us houses outside                            of the city.|joey|  what?
rachel| are you serious?|monica| when we found out that we're gonna get this                            baby, chandler and i started talking and we decided                            that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
phoebe| so you're gonna move?|ross| oh my god.
joey| shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!|rachel| what is wrong with raising a kid in the city?                            i'm doing it, ross is doing it, sarah jessica parker                            is doing it!
monica| and that's great for you guys, but we want                            a lawn and a swingset...|chandler| ...and a street where our kids can ride their                            bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
ross|  so you wanna buy a house in the 50's?|phoebe| have you thought about what you would be giving                            up? you can't move out of the city, what if you want                            chinese food at 5am? or a fake rolex that breaks as                            soon as it rains or an asian hooker sent right to your                            door?
ross| you know what, if you wanna look for a house,                            that's okay.|joey| no, no, it's not, don't listen to him! 
ross| , but                            you're going to realize, this is the only place, you                            wanna be.|chandler| actually, we already found a house we love.
ross| what?|monica| and about an hour ago, we made an offer.
chandler| bet you wish i was having an affair now,                            huh?|ross| you put an offer on a house? 
monica| |phoebe| wha..? again with the nature, what are you?                            beavers?
chandler| i know this is really hard and we're really                            sorry.|joey| is this because i come over here without knocking                            and eat your food?  i really,                            really think i can! 
chandler| |monica| we think if you saw it, you'd understand. i                            mean you guys were there.                             it is beautiful, isn't it?
rachel| yeah it is.|joey| what the hell are you doin'?
rachel| well, it is, all right? when we were out there                            today, all i kept thinking was: i can't believe chandler                            is screwing this woman, but man this would be a nice                            place to live!|phoebe| yeah, but so is this.
ross| yeah, i mean, if you moved there, you have to                            leave here. i mean, how can you leave this place?|rachel|  c'mon daddy, listen                            to me! all of my life, everyone has always told me,                            'you're a shoe! you're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're                            a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what                            if i don't wanna be a shoe? what if i wanna be a- a                            purse, y'know? or a- or a hat! no, i don't want you                            to buy me a hat, i'm saying that i am a ha- it's a metaphor,                            daddy!
ross| you can see where he'd have trouble.|rachel| well maybe i'll just stay here with monica.

phoebe| what else?|monica| when i take a shower, she leaves me little                            notes on the mirror.
rachel| yeah, i do. i-i do, do that.|phoebe| thats nice. i like having things to                            read in the bathroom.
monica| when i fall asleep on the couch after reading,                            she covers me over with a blanket.|rachel| well yknow, i dont want you to                            be cold.
monica| and when i told her that i was gonna be moving                            in with chandler, she was really supportive. |chandler|  hey.
monica| she really left.|chandler| i know. 
monica| thank you.|chandler| no problem roomie. 
monica| can i ask you a question?|chandler| sure!
monica| what the hell is that dog doing here?! |chandler| little toast here. i know this isn't exactly                            the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned,                            but for me, this has been really great, you know, i                            think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile                            vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd                            gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family,                            if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be                            all together, you know? so i guess what i'm trying to                            say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings                            sucked.
all| that's so sweet.|ross| and hey, here's to a lousy christmas.
rachel| and a crappy new year.|chandler| here, here!
joey| rachel's right. this is where you guys belong.                          |phoebe| yeah, you don't wanna live in westchester.                            that's like the worst of the chesters.
ross| you know, sometimes when i'm alone in my apartment,                            i look over here and you guys... are just having dinner                            or... watching tv or something, but... it makes me feel                            better. and now when i look over, who am i gonna see?                            the gottliebs, the yangs? they don't make me feel so                            good. |rachel| yeah. so don't move, okay? just stay here and...                             maybe close your blinds at night.
chandler| hello? it's nancy, they responded to our                            offer.|monica| and?
chandler|  they                            passed. they said they wouldn't go a penny under the                            asking price.|monica| we can't afford that.
chandler| i know.|monica| well, there you go.
joey| i'm really sorry you guys.|ross| yeah. i'm sorry too. i'm even more sorry that                            that phone call didn't come before i told you about                            looking through the window.
rachel| yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|phoebe|  you're gonna be okay?
monica| yeah, we'll be okay.|ross| love you guys. 
joey| you know, i'm really sorry i wasn't more supportive                            before.|chandler| that's okay, we understand.
joey| and about this nancy thing... if you're not sleeping                            with her, should i?|monica| i know there'll be other houses, but it's just                            so... i love that one so much.

chandler| well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.|rachel| 
chandler| so where are you applying to?|rachel| oh well, you know, i think it's kinda really                            important that i go somewhere where there's sun, so                            i'm sort of...  hey!
chandler| i'm in college and i'm in a band.|rachel| 
phoebe| you know, it's fine. we'll pay you.|roy| no, no, you're right. who am i kidding? i should                            have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. what                            am i gonna do? i mean, this has been my life for thirty                            two years. taking my clothes off in front of people                            is all i know.
rachel| no, wait. no there's gotta be something else                            that you can do. i mean, what skills do you have?|roy| i don't know... i can make my pecs dance... i                            can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... i can                            go to that special place inside me where i feel no shame.
rachel| so maybe something in an office.|phoebe| or you could teach stripping. you know, share                            your gift, pass the torch.
roy| you know, actually that's not a bad idea. i can                            do it out of my apartment. i don't think my mom would                            mind.|phoebe| there you go. okay, do you think you're gonna                            be okay?

monica| oh my god! that's wild!|chandler| yeah, but it was like a million years ago,                            so it doesn't matter.
ross| well, it matters to me.|chandler| why?
ross| because... the night you kissed rachel was the                            night i kissed rachel for the very first time.|chandler| you kissed her that night too?
monica| two guys in one night? wow, i thought she became                            a slut after she got her nose fixed.|chandler| seriously, where did this happen?
ross| okay, after you told me she was passed out in                            our room, i went in there to make sure she was all right.                            she was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples' coats.                            well, i went to kiss her on the forehead, you know.                            but it was so dark, i accidentally got her lips. i started                            to pull away, but then i felt her start to kiss me back.                            it was only for a second, but... it was amazing. and                            now, now i find out that you kissed her first.|chandler| oh wait... what bed did you say she was on?
ross| mine.|chandler| i'm pretty sure i put her on my bed.
ross| no, she was definitely on my bed.|chandler| why would i kiss a girl, and then put her                            on your bed?
ross| well, then who was on my bed?|monica| 
ross|  no! no, no!|monica| yes! 
ross| you were under the pile of coats?|monica| i was the pile of coats!
ross| oh my god!|monica| you were my midnight mystery kisser?
ross| you were my first kiss with rachel?|monica| you were my first kiss ever?
chandler| what did i marry into?|monica| oh, crap!
joey| uh, hey.|phoebe| listen, i need to ask you something. ok, you                            know how my step dad's in prison.
joey|  yeah.|phoebe| yeah. well, uhm... listen he was supposed to                            get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding                            tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently                            stabbing iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait                            till monday.
joey| so he can't come?|phoebe| no, and so there's no one to walk me down the                            aisle and... well, i would just really love it if you                            would do it.
joey| seriously? |phoebe| yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like                            a dad to me. i mean, you've always, you know, looked                            out for me and shared your wisdom...
joey| i am pretty wisdomous.|phoebe| so... what do you say?
joey| are you kidding? phoebe, i would be honored.                            |phoebe| oh, thank you. i hope... i hope you know how                            much you mean to me.
joey|  i don't want you to see your                            father cry, go to your room!|joey| oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
phoebe|  hello...                            hey, ok, stop screaming! ok? so, halibut. all right,                            so salmon, either way. i don't-i don't... it doesn't                            matter to me! |monica|  well, it matters to me!
phoebe| well, i don't care, so you pick!|monica| did you just hung up on me?                             all right, look, i need you at the rehearsal dinner                            tonight at 1800 hours.
phoebe| uh-uh. ok. what time is that.|monica| you don't know military time?
phoebe| why, i must have been in missile training the                            day they taught that.|monica| just subtract twelve.
phoebe| ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand,                            seven hundred and...|monica|  six o'clock!
phoebe| ok.|monica| ok. hold on.  oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
phoebe| ice sculpture? that sounds really fancy! i                            told you i just want a simple wedding.|monica| please... honey, leave the details to me. now                            i wanna make this day as special for you as i can. now,                            ok, i was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
phoebe| what harpist? my friend marjorie is playing                            the steel drums.|monica| ooh... she backed out.
phoebe| she did? why?|monica| i made her.  steel drums                            don't really say \elegant wedding\. nor does                            marjorie's overwhelming scent.
phoebe|  hey! she will shower when tibet                            is free.|phoebe| hey!
chandler| you look great. i'm so glad we're having                            this rehearsal dinner, you know, i so rarely get to                            practice my meals before i eat them. |phoebe| okay, what did we say was your one gift to                            us?
chandler| no stupid jokes. i thought that was for the                            actual wedding.|phoebe| rehearse it!
ross| hi! |mike| thanks for coming you guys.
ross| oh,  hey, oh... i... i was-i was going                            for a hand shake.|mike| is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
ross| that is why!|mike| yeah.
phoebe| so rach.|rachel| yeah.
phoebe| where is emma?|rachel| oh, monica made me send her to my mother's.                            apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
monica| |joey| hey, you're mike's parents, right?
joey| ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?|joey| you know, on the one hand you're happy for them,                            but on the other hand it's hard to let go.
joey| hey, i'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy?                            but i'm just trying to be nice for the kids!|chandler|  you know what i just realized?                            we have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
ross| yeah, i thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't                            they have asked us by now? when did they ask you to                            be their bridesmaid?|rachel| uh... november?
ross| i wanna say it's not looking good.|rachel| hey pheebs...
phoebe| what's up?|rachel| uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're                            doing in the wedding yet.
chandler| heh.|phoebe| uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
ross| what? |rachel| well, this is really awkward  oh, and i can leave!
phoebe| i'm sorry you guys but, you know, mike's got                            his brother and his friends from school so... you know,                            you were, you were... if it helps you, you were next                            in line, you just, you just missed the cut.|ross| oh, man!
chandler| this is like figure skating team all over                            again.  help me!|ross| football!
chandler| thank you.|monica|  pheebs,                            spit that out, that has pork in it.
phoebe| oh! i though the pot stickers were supposed                            to be vegetarian!|monica| yeah, i changed them. i, i sent you a fax about                            it!
phoebe| i don't have a fax machine.|monica| ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
ross| i can't believe we're gonna be the only people                            that aren't in this wedding.|chandler| i know, i hate being left out of things.
ross| and it's a wedding! it'd be weird if i'm not                            in it...|mike| hey guys, how is it going?
chandler| fine. we're just sitting here. alone. doing                            nothing. it's our rehearsal for tomorrow.|mike| yeah look, about tomorrow, i... i've got a question                            for ya. i just found out that one of my groomsmen had                            had an emergency and can't make it.
chandler| what happened?|ross| who cares, and?
mike| ...and i was wondering if... you know, maybe                            one of you guys... |ross|  i'll do it!
chandler|  m-me, me, me!|mike| you both wanna do it? uhm... there's only room                            for one.
chandler| pick me, i look great in a tux and i will                            not steal focus.|ross| no, mike, no, no. you wanna pick me, i mean...                            watch!  huh?
mike| you know, i really don't feel very comfortable                            making this decision. you know, phoebe knows you better,                            i'm gonna let her choose. |ross|  well, if phoebe's choosing, then                            say hello to mike's next groomsman.
chandler| oh, i will. but i will need a mirror... as                            he is me!|ross| please, you're going down!
chandler| you are going downer!|ross| is that what they say on the figure skating team?
chandler| |mike| yeah, yeah. hey, thanks for doing that.
joey| oh, hey, my pleasure.  so what are your intentions with my phoebe?|mike| i intend to marry her.
joey| oh, a wiseacre. . no,                            no, no, i understand you plan to support your wife by                            playing the piano? isn't that kind of unstable?|mike| no more so than acting.
joey| strike two!|mike| you're right. she probably will support me. hey,                            unless we move in with you, dad?
joey| strike three! you only get one more, mike!|ross| so, what did you decide?
phoebe| i decided to pee.|chandler| mike didn't tell you? you have to choose                            one of us to be in your wedding. one of his groomsmen                            fell out.
phoebe| oh no, no. i can't choose between you two!                            i love you both so much!|chandler| just not enough to put us in the original                            wedding party.
phoebe| oh, i don't wanna choose! it's . oh okay, wait. rach! listen i have a very special                            bridesmaid task for you today.|rachel|  goody, what is it!
phoebe| well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman                            and you have to choose between ross and chandler. so                            good luck with that.|rachel| what, what, what, no, i don't wanna do that.
phoebe| all right, i guess i'll have to find a new                            bridesmaid.|ross| i'll do it! 
monica| ok, it's 2100 hours. |mike| do i have a minute to go to the bathroom?
monica| you had a bathroom break at 2030. pee on your                            own time, mike! . now, in regard                            to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing                            kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. okay. you                            just get in, do your thing and get out!|mike| is that what you say to chandler?
monica| |phoebe| ok. hello everyone and thank you all for being                            here tonight. so tomorrow's the big event and some of                            you might not know, but mike and i didn't get off to                            the best start.  but despite, you know... it got...                            it got good. ok, i wanna take a moment to mention my                            mother, who couldn't be here...
phoebe| and... moment's over!  you                            know what? you're done.|monica| what?
phoebe| you're fired! |rachel| happy wedding day!
phoebe| oh, happy my wedding day to you!|rachel| okie-dokey, joey, listen. this is gonna be                            bridesmaid central, all right? we're gonna have hair                            and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, i had to                            move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for                            the corsages.
joey| oh, man! i wouldn't have had breakfast if i knew                            there was going to be corsages! |monica| hi. about last night... i know you are under                            a lot of stress and even though the things you said                            hurt me a little bit... my point is, uh, well, i'm willing                            to take my job back.
phoebe| oh, well that's ok. i think you and i will                            do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.|monica| oh, is that so? ok. if that's really what you                            want, then here... i give you the headset. well, i don't                            really want to give you the headset. well i guess if                            you're taking over, you should probably return these                            messages. 
phoebe| wow, this is a lot!|monica| uh-huh, but i'm sure you can handle this. i                            mean, i have won awards for my organizational skills,                            but, uh, i'm sure you'll do fine.
phoebe| you won awards?|monica| mm-mh. i printed them out on my computer.
ross| hey!|monica| hi.
ross| where's rach?|monica| she's in her room, why?
ross| i have to talk to her about this groomsman situation,                            ok? i'm not gonna watch chandler up there while i'm                            sitting in the seats like some chump!  oh! my god! you're breathtaking! |rachel| what d'you want?
ross| you haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman                            yet, have you?|rachel| oh, ross, c'mon, please! don't make this harder                            than it already is!
ross| i'm not! i'm making it easier! pick me!|rachel| well, chandler said that it's really important                            to him too!
ross| listen, listen. whoever you pick is gonna walk                            down the aisle with you! now, i promise i won't say                            a word, but if you pick chandler he's gonna be whispering                            stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!|rachel| oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
ross|  yes,                            yes!|monica| i know.
mike| hey.|phoebe| listen, mike, if you were swedish and you were                            saying the word \lorkins\ what flowers would                            that be?
mike|  orchids?|phoebe| right there! that's why i'm marrying you!
joey|  hello michael.|mike| joseph.
joey| may i have a word with you, please?|mike|  this is... great...
joey| have a seat.                             i cannot allow this. |mike|  are you rehearsing for some really                            bad mafia movie?
joey| more back talk. and yes, i may be borrowing a                            few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for \family                            honor 2: thissa time itsa personal.\ |mike| joey, i kinda have a lot to do today, what do                            you want?
joey| i want you to take this seriously! phoebe is                            very very important to me, ok? and i wanna make sure                            that you are gonna take care of her.|mike|  joe, i love phoebe. she's the single                            most important thing in my life. i'd die before i let                            anything happen to her. 
joey|  that's what i wanted                            to hear! because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna                            be family, and there is nothing more important in the                            whole world, than family. |mike| that must have been one lousy movie.
joey|  that was me!|chandler| hey, can i talk to you about this groomsman                            thing? if you pick ross, he'll walk you down the isle                            just fine. but if you choose me, you'll be getting some                            comedy!
rachel| even so, i think i'm gonna pick ross.|chandler| let me tell you why you need to pick me.                             see, when                            i was a kid, i was always left out of everything, you                            know, and it really made me feel... insecure. you know,                            i was always picked last in gym. even behind that big                            fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules                            to baseball. i mean, this guy would strike out and then                            run to third. anyway, if i'm the only one left out of                            this wedding, i just know that all those feelings are                            gonna come rushing back. 
rachel| all right fine, i pick you.|chandler|                             y-y-yeeesss! make \groom\ for chandler.
rachel|  oh my...|joey| i'm glad we had this little talk.
mike| yes. yeah and thanks for all the wedding night                            advice.  that didn't make me uncomfortable                            at all! alright, so i'll see everybody tonight?|phoebe| okay.
monica| bye.|mike| uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant                            ice sculpture in the hall? 
phoebe| oh my god, what's it doing here? |monica|  uh! what a pickle.
phoebe|  oh my god, everything is                            such a mess. why is this happening to me? |joey| 
ross|  good. i'm just getting some                            coffee. so i'm alert for the wedding.|chandler|  that's what i was                            doing too.
ross|  well,                            you have fun tonight.|chandler| you too. 
ross| oh, i will.|chandler| me too.

mike| oh, you haven't picked yet. oh good, 'cause i                            had an idea. i thought it would be fun if the third                            groomsman was my family dog. chappy. |ross| what? a dog? no! rachel gets to choose. 
rachel|  wow, this is a tough one. i think                            i'm gonna have to go with the dog.|phoebe| alright, wait, so what you're saying is that                            the chef is at the hamilton club, but the food is not                            and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not?                            are you, are you freaking kidding me!? 
monica|  how's it going?                          |phoebe|  help me.
monica| what? |phoebe| i want you to be crazy bitch again. 
monica|  really? |phoebe|  please?

phoebe|  about what?|joey| the blizzard. i just saw on the news, it's like                            the worst snow storm in 20 years! they already closed                            all the bridges and tunnels. 
monica| ooh! but the band and the photographer are                            coming all the way in from new jersey!|joey| i don't think they are.
ross|  so sorry                            pheebs. |joey| yeah according to the news, most of the city                            did.
rachel| since when do you watch the news? |joey| uh, for your information, since they hired a                            very hot weather girl.
ross|  i can't believe you guys                            aren't going to be able to get married today.|phoebe| i know.
rachel| wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there.                            you always wanted to get married outside. why don't                            you guys just do it on the street?|phoebe| what? 
rachel| well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. i                            mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. this                            could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!|phoebe|  what do you think? 
mike| i think i wanna get married to you today. |phoebe| me too!  monica, do you                            think we could do it?
monica|  affirmative!|mike| hey! you made it. great! chappy! hi!  mom, i know getting married                            in the street isn't something you approve of...
mike|  you know, chappy's too                            small to handle all this snow. someone's gonna have                            to walk him down the aisle.|chandler| so technically, would this person be in the                            wedding?
mike| i guess.|chandler and ross| i'll do it!
ross| no, but chandler, hello... aren't you scared                            of dogs?|chandler| i'm not scared.  he                            can sense my fear. my throat is exposed.
ross|  he stinks!|monica| level 1 alert. i repeat, level 1. this is not                            a drill. okay we've got a situation. the minister just                            called. he's snowed in. he can't make it.
mike| oh, no! |joey| oh hey, don't worry. i'm still ordained from                            your wedding.
monica| really?|joey| yeah, you'd think i'd give up being a minister                            and start paying to ride the subway? uhh-uh...
ross| uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.|joey| i had to read the bible pretty carefully, but...                            yeah we do.
monica| okay, if joey does the ceremony, then we have                            to find someone else to walk phoebe down the isle.|chandler|  i'll do it.
ross| i'll...|chandler|                             ah ah...
monica| okay, mike and joey, get in position. chandler,                            come with me. |monica| okay, joey's doing the ceremony and chandler's                            giving you away.

rachel| taking advantage? i'm giving you the advantage,                            enjoy!|ross| look, i'm sure it would be great, but i-i think                            one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, i'm gonna                            go!
rachel| wow. ok.|ross| i'll see you in the morning .
rachel| mhm-mh!|ross|  haven't                            had sex in four months, i should get a medal for that!
monica| oh, i'm glad. listen, i want to apologize about                            chandler, though. i just did not see this coming.|chandler|  new york is awesome!
monica| what is with you?|chandler| yeah, i've been to these places before, but                            i've never really seen them, you know.
monica| yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.|erica| thanks so much for showing me around.
monica| oh! it was our pleasure. we are so much enjoying                            getting to know you.|erica| well, if there is anything else you wanna know...                            
chandler| oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask                            you some questions about the father? |erica| oh, sure. yeah, well, he was my high school                            boyfriend. captain of the football team, really cute                            and he got a scholarship and went off to college. 
chandler| that's great. |erica| yeah... it's almost definitely him. 
monica| how's that now?|erica| well, there is a chance it's another guy. i                            mean, i have only ever been with two guys, but they                            sorta overlapped. 
chandler| so, what does the other guy do? does he go                            to college too? |erica| no, he's in prison. 
monica| was he falsely accused of something? |erica| no... he killed his father with a shovel.  but other than that, he's                            a great guy. 
chandler| i'll bet his dad doesn't think so.|monica| are you awake? 
chandler| of course i'm awake. assume from now on that                            i'm always awake! |monica| alright, we don't know that it's him. i mean,                            it could be the football guy. 
chandler| honey, it's us. of course it's the shovel-killer.|monica| alright, lets say that it is him, would we                            not want the baby? no! would we treat him any differently?
chandler| i'd keep an eye on him! we have to find out                            which one the father is. |monica| how? 
chandler| i dunno, aren't there tests for these things,                            right?|monica| yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting. 
chandler| pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer.                            he probably loves him mommy. he's probably got a tattoo                            that says \mom\ on his shovel-wielding arm!|joey| huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
tape| good job.|joey| thank you. 
phoebe| hey joey.|joey| hey!
phoebe| listen, i feel really badly about yesterday                            and i thought about it a lot and, and i know, i was                            too impatient. so lets try it again.|joey| oh, no, that's okay, i don't need your help.                            i worked on it myself and i gotta say, i am pretty good!
phoebe| really, can i hear some of it. |joey| sure, sure. ok,                             see?
phoebe| well, you're not,  you're not... you're not...                            again, you're not speaking french! |joey|  oh well i think i am, yeah and i think                            i'm definitely gonna get the part.
phoebe| how could you possibly think that? |joey| for one thing, the guy on the tape said i was                            doing a good job!
rachel| |ross| you've been quiet all morning. is everything                            okay? 
rachel| hmm-hmm. |ross| you sure you're alright?
rachel|  yep.|ross| 
rachel| fyi..|ross| 
rachel| in the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised                            sympathy sex... just do it. |ross|                             you're mad at me about last night? i was just trying                            to do the right thing.
rachel|  really? well, it seems to me                            if you'd done the right thing, i would not have woken                            up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, i would have                            woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!|ross|                             well...
rachel| oh stop that! |ross| i can't believe this. i was just being a good                            guy. i treated you with respect and understanding. 
rachel| |rachel| oh, really, well ross, you know what? i am                            a big girl. i don't need someone telling me what is                            best for me.
ross| i gotta say, i have not had sex a lot of times                            before, this is the worst ever.|rachel| oh, really, really? well, it wasn't very good                            for me either. 
ross| hey you know what? you know what? to avoid this                            little thing in the future, let's just say, you and                            me, never having sex again.|rachel| what?
ross| that's right, sex is off the table. |erica| 
chandler|  oh, really? |erica| no!  you we're right, that was fun!                            i'm gonna go finish packing.
chandler| o-okay.  so, is she gonna take the test?|monica| nope, she doesn't have to, i found out who                            the father is.
chandler| oh god. it's shovely-joe, isn't it? |monica|  no it's not. 
chandler| how do you know? |erica| well, it turns out that erica didn't pay much                            attention in sex ed class, because the thing she did                            with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make                            a baby that way. 
chandler| oh god! what was it? the thing that we hardly                            ever do or the thing we never do?|monica| the thing we never do.
chandler|  shovely joe!|joey| right.  dja bu bu claude.                            uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
casting assistant| i'm sorry, what's going on?|joey| dude, come on! french it u-up!
director| joey, do you speak french?|joey| toutes la smore! bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! pfoof!
director| you know what. i think this audition is over.                            |phoebe|  uh, excuse me. uh, i am                            regin philange. i was passing by when i heard                            this man speaking the regional dialect of my french                            town of este lauder.
director| you really think this man is speaking french?|joey| sa-sa-saw!
phoebe| coutez, je vais vous dire la vrit.                            c'est mon petit frre. il est un peu retard.                            |director|  good job, little buddy. that was                            some really good french. but i think we're gonna go                            with someone else for the part.
joey| ah. all right. but my french was good?|director| it was great.
joey|  oh-hoh! ha-hah! see!|phoebe| 
joey| yeah-hah. toute-de-le-fruit.|rachel| oh, good.
ross| so uh... i guess i wanna take off.|rachel| okay... hey listen, just before you go i-i                            again, i just wanna say \thank you\ for coming                            with me.
ross| oh, no problem.|rachel| and also, you know i uh, i was thinking about                            what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and...                            it's probably not a great idea to go down that road                            again.
ross| thank you. i'm glad you agree.|rachel| it's a shame though, i mean, when we did it,                            it was pretty good.
ross| yeah... yeah, that's true.|rachel| hey uhm, do you remember that one really great                            time...?
ross| oh, ye-ah!|rachel| you know it was you're uhm... birthday...
ross| ...valentine's day...|both|  oh yeah!
rachel| well, i guess that's all in the past, now.|ross| hmmm-mmmm.
rachel|  not even one more time?|ross| not even once.
rachel| no matter how much we want it.|ross| even if we want it really bad.
rachel| that's what we decided.|ross| uhm, right!
rachel| ...it's kinda hard though!|ross| yeah.
rachel| you know, when two people have a connection,                            you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.|ross| ...i hate waste.
rachel| ...ross?|ross| yes?
rachel| just so you know... with us... it's never off                            the table. |ross| damn it. it's never off the table. 
joey| no.|phoebe| it's off the resum. 
phoebe| archery?|joey| no.
phoebe| horseback riding?|joey| would fall off a lot.
phoebe| you can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?|joey| that i can do.
phoebe| come on! you can drink a gallon of milk in                            10 seconds?|joey| al, right, watch me!  okay, you time me. ready?

chandler| yeah, i don't know why we hang out with married                            couples more often.|monica| well, because every time we do, you make jokes                            about swinging and scare them away.
chandler| you mean that portuguese couple? yeah, like                            you wouldn't have done it. |ross|  hey, you guys... i have great news.

monica| no, no. it felt nice to acknowledge this. |phoebe| where did you go to do it?
monica| uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...|chandler| you never did it!
monica| i'm sorry. it's just the idea of being an official                            bing.|chandler| hey! i will have you know that... aah, who                            am i kidding. let's call the kid geller and let bing                            die with me.
mike|  here                            you go.|phoebe| thanks! honey, would you want me to take your                            name?
mike| oh, it's just... it's up to you. it's your name.                            you've got to live with it. |phoebe| all right, let's see, call me mrs hannigan.

joey|  hey guys.|chandler| hey joe! we've got a couple of things we've                            got to check out at the new house. you want to come                            with us?
joey| no, thank you.|monica| all right. i know you're not happy about us                            moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the                            house.
chandler| yeah, come with us. you'll see how close                            it is to the city.|joey| but no, it's not close. you said it was in escrow?                            i couldn't even find it on the map.
monica| joey, please come. it would mean so much to                            us.|joey| you know what? you are my friends, i wanna be                            supportive, i will come with you. shotgun!

phoebe| okay!|monica|  i'll pick you up at eleven. so glad                            you're coming.
phoebe| good for you. that was really mature.|joey| what? no, the only reason i'm going to their                            stupid new house, is so i can point out everything that's                            wrong with it, so they don't move. i'm gonna make them                            stay here.
mike| you're a strange kind of grown-up.|phoebe| joey, you can't make someone do something they                            don't want to do. believe me, there's something i've                            been trying to get mike to do in bed and there's...                            he's just... 
mike| woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... can we not talk about that                            right now?|phoebe| all right, prude... look, monica and chandler                            really love this house. you are not gonna talk them                            into staying here.
joey| hey, hey... i can convince people to do anything,                            you know. i bet i can even get mike to do that \thing\.                            what is it?|joey| i am not gonna help you do that! goodbye! 
rachel|  hi, i'm here to see mr campbell...                            with gucci. the reservation is probably under gucci.                            it's spelled like gukki, which could be confusing.|rachel| oh my god! that's my boss. you have to seat                            us somewhere else.

mr campbell| maybe people... found it weird.... so,                            why do you want to leave ralph lauren?|rachel| what? i-i don't.
mr campbell| you don't?|rachel| no, i-i-i love it there. 
mr campbell| well, if you don't want to leave, why                            are we having this lunch?|mr campbell| what?
mr campbell| that's hugo boss?|phoebe|  but you obviously haven't.
clerk| how can i help you? |phoebe| i need to change my name, please. see, i need                            to change it because i'm-i'm hiding from the law.  you're                            fun.
clerk| you need to fill out this form.  |phoebe| okay, well, i just don't, i don't know how                            it works exactly. see, my name is buffay and my husband's                            name is hannigan, so is it supposed to be buffay-hannigan                            or hannigan-buffay?
clerk| it can be anything you want.|phoebe| well, not anything, i mean...
clerk| yeah... anything.|phoebe| oh, this could take a while.
clerk| get out of my line.|phoebe| okay.
phoebe| hey!|monica| hey pheebs.
phoebe| oh, not anymore. i changed it today.|monica| oh, i'm sorry, mrs hannigan.
phoebe| wrong again! apparently you can change it to                            anything you want. so i thought, all right, here's an                            opportunity to be creative. so meet princess consuela                            banana hammock.|chandler| that's what we were gonna name the baby.
monica| phoebe!|phoebe| uh! princess consuela.
monica| you seriously changed your name to that?|phoebe| uh-huh! 
monica| okay, so from now on we have to call you princess                            consuela?|phoebe| uhm, no. i'm gonna have my friends call me                            valerie.
chandler| hey, how'd the interview go?|rachel| oh! it's not good.
chandler| you know, i always feel that way after an                            interview. i'll bet it went better than you think.|rachel| well, i didn't get the job at gucci and i got                            fired from ralph lauren.
chandler| that is a bad interview.|phoebe| what are you, what are you talking about? how                            did this happen?
rachel| well, my boss was at the same restaurant where                            i was having my interview and he heard everything. so                            later he calls me to his office and he tells me that                            he's gonna have to let me go, because i'm not a team                            player. and i said \wait a minute! yes i am.\                            and i had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved                            that that in fact... was true. |monica| oh god. i'm so sorry.
ross| hey! wha-hoo! what's this?                             well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. why is this                            here?|phoebe| ross...
ross| i guess it's here because i got tenure!|ross| this is the single greatest day of my professional                            career. gunther, six glasses!
gunther| six? you want me to join you?|ross| oh, i thought joey was here. five is good.  well, i'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee                            tomorrow. 
chandler| ooh! israeli champagne. and it's vanilla!|ross| i got tenure. i didn't win the lottery... hey                            rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
rachel| oh it... good! yeah, but i'm not gonna hear                            from that for a couple of days.|ross| oh, you know what? you're gonna get it. i-i-i-i                            can feel it.
phoebe| can you?|rachel| ah, all right. here's to ross!
ross| and-and to years of hard work finally paying                            off.|phoebe| and to knowing that your career doesn't mean                            everything. 
ross| but also knowing it means a lot.|monica| but more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
ross| ...that center around work.|chandler| to ross!
ross| you know what the best part about this is? i                            can never be fired.|phoebe| oh god!
ross| no seriously. i have job security for life. you                            know, i never have to worry.                             oh, look at you. look how happy you are for me.|rachel|  no, it's not that. i got fired today.                            and i didn't get the other job.
ross| rach, i'm so sorry.|rachel| oh!
ross| great. i feel like an idiot.|rachel| no, it's okay, you didn't know.
ross| oh...  little heads-up would have                            been nice.|monica| thank you for letting us see the house again.
chandler| and thank you for explaining to us what escrow                            means... i've already forgotten what you said, but thank                            you.|realtor| take as long as you want. just let me know                            when you're through.  
monica| ah, so glad you decided to come.|joey| me too. yeah, this place is great. i'm so happy                            for you guys. although, you know, i hope you like fungus.
chandler| what?|joey| fungus! yeah. place is full of it.
monica| no it's not. we had an inspection and they                            didn't find anything.|joey| okay. then i guess i have dry eyes and a scratchy                            throat for no reason.
monica| maybe because it's you hung your head out of                            the window like a dog the whole ride here.|joey| maybe. so this is the living room huh? ooh, it's                            pretty dark.  
monica| no it's not!|joey|  are you kiddin'? i think                            i just saw a bat in the corner!
chandler| when your head was hanging out the window,                            it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?|joey|                             maybe. well, i just think you guys can do better than                            this house, you know? or any other house for that matter.
monica| oh joey, look, we know you're having a hard                            time with this, but we really, we love it here. |joey| fine, ok, if you love this house so much, then                            you should just live here, okay? i just hope you get                            used to that weird humming sound.  hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... 
monica| joey, we know that's you.|joey| no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm

joey|  oh.|mackenzie|  i hate my parents.
joey| i hate my friends.  alright, look. there's gotta be a                            way that we can stop this from happening.|mackenzie| like what? 
joey|  uhm... oh! okay. you come with me,                            and you tell them that the house is haunted!|mackenzie| what are you? eight? 
joey| woah, uh! okay, let's hear your great idea.|mackenzie| i don't have any great ideas. i am eight.
joey|  ahh! there's gotta be a way. i mean,                            you know, if monica and chandler move out here and now                            phoebe is married to mike. that just leaves me and ross                            and rach, you know what i mean? |mackenzie| i really don't.
joey| what am i gonna do, i feel like i'm losing my                            friends.|mackenzie| my parents say i'm gonna make new friends.
joey| oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. me,                            i'm set in my ways.|mackenzie| this is what my mom was talking about. whiners                            are wieners.  look, you                            want your friends to be happy, right? 
joey| yeah, yeah, i guess.|mackenzie| well, if moving here is gonna make them                            happy, don't you want them to do it? 
joey|  yeah, maybe.|mackenzie| then you gotta let them go. 
joey|  i hate                            to admit it, but you're probably right. how did you                            get to be so smart?|mackenzie| i read a lot.
joey| |man| hey rach, i just heard. i'm so sorry.
rachel| oh, thank you... |man| you still don't know my name, do you? 
rachel| |rachel|  ross, what is taking you so long?

rachel| |mark| how've you been?
rachel| i'm fantastic. you remember ross? |mark| sure, sure.

rachel| oh, well,  you're                            not catching me on my best day.|mark| yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly                            say big promotion.
rachel| no, but it's good, you know, i'm gonna take                            some time off and do some charity work.|mark| are you sure, because we may have something at                            louis vuitton.
rachel| well, screw charity work. what've you got?|mark| why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about                            it?

ross| i hate that guy.|rachel| oh.
ross| no, no, no, you cannot go to dinner with him.|rachel| what? you don't want me to get a job?
ross| oh yeah, i'm sure he's gonna give you a job.                            maybe make you his sexretary.|rachel| ugh. 
ross| i'm serious. i just don't trust that guy, okay?|rachel| ross, you know what? 
monica| oh, i love this street. the trees, the big                            front yards, the actual picket fences.|chandler| man, those two dogs are going at it!

chandler| really? what changed your mind?|joey| oh well, the little girl who lives here made                            me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
chandler| joey, there was a little girl who lived here,                            but she died like 30 years ago.|joey|  what?
chandler| ha! i'm just messing with you.|joey| that's not funny! you know i'm afraid of little                            girl ghosts!

ross| that guy mark. from bloomingdale's... she thinks                            he's just being nice to her. but i know he really wants                            to sleep with her.|chandler| it's seven years ago.                             my time machine works!
ross| we ran into him on the street today and he said                            he might have a job for her. but i know he just wants                            to get into her pants.|monica| so what if he wants to sleep with her? i mean,                            she's single and he's cute.

chandler| how did the job stuff go?|rachel| he offered me one.
chandler| that's great!|ross| congratulations!
rachel| i know, it's amazing. it's amazing. it's so                            much better than what i had at ralph lauren. the money                            is great...|ross| can we, can we just stop for a second? who said                            something better would come along, huh? you didn't believe                            me. i told you everything was gonna work out.                             you know what? this calls for a bottle of israels finest.
rachel| the job is in paris. |joey| i mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but...                            am i missing opportunities? you know, i've always thought                            of myself as a serious actor. i mean, should i be trying                            to do more independent movies?
mackenzie| |joey| hey bear, i need some career advice.
jennifer| previously on friends...|chandler| how did the job stuff go?
rachel| he offered me one.|ross|  you know what? this calls for a bottle of israels finest.
rachel| the job is in paris. |rachel| oh, god! please, somebody  say something.
ross| so if you take this job you'll be moving to paris?|chandler| or facing a bitch of a commute.
rachel| i know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away    from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. and i've already    talked to them about our situation with emma, and they said they'll do whatever    we need to make us feel comfortable.|ross| okay.
rachel| i mean, i'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out...    anything we want.|chandler| my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. 
ross| all right, we'll work it out.|rachel| thank you! thank you!
ross| yeah, yeah!  you sure this is what you want?|rachel| i think it is. 
phoebe| ooh, what's going on?|rachel| i got a really incredible job offer.
joey| hey, great! all right!|phoebe| good for you!
rachel| it's in paris.|joey| what? no, no, no! no, no... no... no, no... no, too much is changing,    okay? first, phoebe getting married ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid    suburbs...
monica| hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...|joey| well, it comes and goes. i wouldn't trust it.
rachel| look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. and it means    a lot if you could try to get on board.|phoebe| of course we can. congratulations.  joey...
joey| no, no, no. my hugs are reserved for people staying in america.|rachel|  joey, it would mean so...
joey| hey! no! get your france-going-arms away from me. |rachel| joey...
phoebe| you okay with this?|chandler| well, it makes me feel sad, but...
phoebe| talking to ross.|chandler| i see.
ross| well, rachel moving to another country? not being able to see her every    day. how can i be okay with this?|monica| i know, but what are we gonna do? she really needs this job.
ross| do you think if the ralph lauren people offered her her old job back,    she would take it?|monica| how is that gonna happen?
chandler| is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?|ross| i don't know. i could talk to her boss. yeah! i met him at that christmas    party. we really hit it off.
monica| you mean the guy who kept calling you ron?|ross| i didn't say we were brothers.
monica| hey phoebe. hey, tell me what you think. all right. the house next    door to the one that we're buying in westchester? just went on the market. i wanna    take a look at it, but chandler doesn't.|chandler| we close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse    us, and we're easily confused. we're not very bright.
monica| but what if it is better than ours? should we at least look?|chandler| what do you think pheebs?
phoebe| well, i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin    robbins... anyway... hey, isn't joey's agent estelle leonard?|chandler| yeah.
phoebe| she died.|chandler| you're kidding!
monica| that's terrible!|phoebe| yeah, last saturday. wow! she was the first black man to fly solo across    the atlantic.  oh, wait a minute, i read the    wrong one.
chandler| oh yeah? |phoebe| yeah, she was just an agent.
monica| joey's gonna be *so* upset. |chandler| i know. *he* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the    atlantic.
phoebe| well, we cannot tell joey about this. he's already flipping out about    everything that's changing. this will push him over the edge.|monica| seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
phoebe| well, not for a little while. let's just give him a few days to get    used to everything else.|monica| what if he reads it in the paper?
chandler| unless snoopy says it to charlie brown, i think we're okay.|ross| yeah, i'm a friend of rachel green's. uhm, actually we met at the christmas    party about two years ago.
mr zelner| oh right, uhm, don?|ross| close. ron. 
mr zelner| uh... what can i do for you?|ross| uhm, well... i'm here to see if you'll give rachel her job back.
mr zelner| ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?|ross| oh, no. at first i have to get you to agree. then we'll    see if she wants to come back.
mr zelner| wow, that is tempting. |ross| look, she loved her job here. and let's face    it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. isn't that    true?
mr zelner| she is good!|ross|  huh, i took a shot there.
mr zelner| but i'm sorry. there's nothing i can do... ah,    it's not true, there is... nothing i want to do.|ross| i see... thanks very much.  is this your son?
mr zelner| yeah, his name is ross.  what?|ross| oh, nothing, its just, its close to ron. does he.. does    little ross like dinosaurs by any chance? 
mr zelner| yeah, they're all he talks about, why?|ross| how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after    everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants.    . i just heard it as you must have heard it and thats    not good. let me start again. im a paleontologist, youll be there    with us and the touching refers only to bones fossils!
mr zelner| you can really arrange that?|ross| you let rachel come back, and its done. 
mr zelner| well, i guess having rachel back wouldnt be the worst thing    in the world.|ross| yeah! yes! thank you! this is great. thank you so much. and i swear,    your kid is going to have the time of his life.
mr zelner| thats great. i worry about little ross. hes always    reading, he's collecting rocks and hes obsessed with dinosaurs.|ross| hell be fine.
joey| hey phoebe.|phoebe| hey. everything ok?
joey| im just mad at my agent.|phoebe| estelle? why?
joey| theres a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i    didnt even be put up for it! shed better have a good reason.|phoebe| im guessing she does.
phoebe| well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. all right, i gotta go. just listen. promise me, that you    will wait a minute before you call her.|joey| ok. why?
phoebe| because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.    |joey| i love that saying!
joey| hello?|joey| i was just gonna call you! thats weird.
joey| yeah, actually i am!|joey| thats it? you know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
joey| no, no, look. all im saying is that youre my agent, ok?    and youre not getting me into any auditions and im tired of it.|joey| im saying that .
phoebe| man, tough week for estelle!|ross| hi.
rachel| hi.|ross| emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. you know she cant sleep    without it.
rachel| oh, well, shes asleep now. stop forcing that thing on her.|ross| ok.
rachel| oh, youre not gonna believe what happened to me today! ralph    lauren called, and gave me my job back!|ross| nooo!
rachel| yee. i mean, it was so weirdest thing. they fired me and then out    of nowhere they just hire me back! i mean, that place must have been falling    apart without me.|ross| so, youre not going to paris.
rachel| no, im still going.|ross| wh whwhat?
rachel| when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back,    the offered me more money! isnt that great?|ross| yeeeah!  
lady| oh, sure. im showing it to someone else right now,    but please, look around.|monica| thanks.
chandler| it feels like were cheating on our house.    and if were gonna cheat, shouldnt it be with like a hot, younger house,    that does stuff that our house wont do?|monica| ours is so much better! this living room is smaller, the dining room looks    like a cave! what a hole!
lady| so? what do you think?|monica| love it!
lady| well, we already have one offer on it, and i think the lady    upstairs is goning to make another one.|monica| they could be our neighbors, what are they like?
lady| oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. she and her husband have two kids,    he's on wall street and she|janice| oh my god!
phoebe| hey joey, want come with me to are you ok?|joey| yeah, i just i just feel bad about firing estelle. this is got to be    killing her.
phoebe| no, that wouldnt kill her. ordinary embolism might.|joey| i dont know. shes got to be taking it hard, i was like    her only client. except for this guy who eats paper. and im guessing    he eats more money than he makes. look, i know shes not a great agent, but    she did stick with me for ten years. im gonna call her and hire her again.
phoebe| no, no, no! don't call her! you wait for her to call    you |joey| why?
phoebe| because patience is the road to understanding  which ...    is the key... to a happy heart.|joey|  you blow me away. 
phoebe|  all right, so promise you're gonna wait for her    to call you?|joey| i promise. and that means, never having to give a reason. 
chandler| and yet i never run into beyonce!|realtor| you two know each other?
janice| oh, we go way back. before monica made an honest man    out of him, chandler used to be my little love muffin! |chandler| 
monica| no, actually, we're buying the house next door. |chandler|  why!?
monica|  i don't know    why.|janice| ooh, that decides it then. i was on the fence.    but knowing that you two would be our neighbors? ah! now we have to    get it!  
chandler| this can not be happening!|monica| okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer.    maybe the janice's won't get it! maybe the other couple will.
chandler| the only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple    are the hitlers.|monica|     all right. what if we got both houses? huh? we can turn this house    into a guest house.
chandler| that is a great idea! and by the way, i don't mean to sound distasteful,    but when did you start crapping money!?|monica| okay, you come up with an idea.
chandler| alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on    our house. we can still get out.|monica| but we love our house.
chandler| will we love it so much with her next door? and she's gonna be louder    out here too. just the crickets and  \oh my god\!  |monica| okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever    we go! i mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise.    i mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls    jump back up inside your body. 
chandler| |ross|     look, i um, i now rachel turned you down but i think there is a way you might    be able to get her to come back. 
mr zelner| this may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees,    is not my main job.|ross| just hear me out. how would you feel about offering her a raise? 
mr zelner|  not good, ron. |ross| perhaps i can persuade you. what if you can give your son this  replica.
mr zelner| |ross| huh? so? we have a deal?
mr zelner| okay, you got it.|ross| yes! yes! 
mr zelner| this is gonna make me very popular.|ross| oh,  believe me, the ladies, they love it!
mr zelner|  i meant with my son.|ross| good, 'cause the ladies, not so much. 
joey| oh my god.  hello?|phoebe| 
joey| estelle?|phoebe| yeah, i wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for    firing me.
joey|  ok-ay. i just, i can't believe you're calling me?|phoebe| well, i didn't think i should just drop by...
joey| no, no, no!  don't drop by,    don't drop by!|phoebe| anyway, you did what you had to do. i'm okay.
joey| can i ask you something? uhm, what's it like there?|phoebe|  it's alright. look kiddo, i gotta go. good luck with    the career. you're gonna be huge.
joey| thanks for everything estelle. bye.     \out of area\. boy, i'll say.|chandler| the hitlers will be so disappointed.
janice| all right, i got to run. tell monica i say goodbye. and... i'll see    you later, neighbor. |chandler| wait! i just want you to know that... i'm so happy you're going to    be here.
janice| oh, me too... |chandler| because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
janice| huh?|chandler| i never stopped loving you.
janice| oh... my...|chandler| yeah, yeah, yeah! i want you... i need you... i must have you janice    litman goralnik neihosenstein.
janice| chandler, what are you talking about?|chandler| now that you live next door, we can be together every day. sid and    monica never have to know a thing.
janice| i don't know what to say... i mean, you know, obviously we have this...    heat between us.|chandler|  obviously.
janice| but i love my husband. and i know you love your wife. now, i don't    think we should get this house now.|chandler| don't say that. don't tangle the dream and take it away.
janice| chandler, one of us has got to be strong.|chandler| i understand.
janice| although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... |chandler|  they're never coming down now.
rachel| hi!|ross| hey!
rachel| you are never going to believe what happened to me today.|ross| what?
rachel| ralph lauren called again and they offered    me more money.|ross| they did?
rachel| yeah. it was the weirdest thing. zelner called me and he said we'll    do everything we can to get you back. and that i should thank some ron... i    don't even know what department that guy's in.|ross| so, what are you gonna do?
rachel| well, i took it.|ross| that's great! so you're staying in new york!

rachel| yeah, you know, was i looking forward to going to    paris? sure. you know, was i excited about working in the fashion capital    of the world? ooh, absolutely... oh...! yeah, but you know, this is... it's    fine. i'm fine going back to a job where i've pretty much gotten everything out of    that i possibly can... |ross| uhm, i hadn't no you... i had no idea you were so excited about paris.    uhm, i mean, you said you were scared.
rachel| well yeah, but i mean, it was good scared though, you know? like when    i-moved-to-new-york scared. or uhm, when i-found-out-i-was-gonna-have-emma scared...    but this is... fine. this is gonna be good. |ross|  you should go.
rachel| what?|ross| it's what you want. you should go.
rachel| you really think so?|ross| i really do.
rachel| but i already told zelner that i would come back...|ross|  i'm sure he'll    understand.
rachel| all right. all right! i'm gonna do it. i'm gonna go to paris.|ross| yeah...
rachel| yeah! i'm going to paris. thank you, ross!|ross| yeah, yeah, oh! 
rachel| oh! oh, i'm so happy.|ross| then i'm happy too. 
rachel| ok! can't believe i'm risking                            this again, but you're on! all right joe, you remember                            the rules! heads i win, tails you lose.|joey| just flip!

monica| you don't mind me touching                            your belly, do you?|erica| no, i don't mind you touching                            my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking                            the part where the baby is gonna come out.
ross| hey! |erica| hi.
ross| hey erica, welcome back to town!                             wow, look how big you've gotten.|erica| that's because i'm pregnant!
ross| right, no, i understand.|erica| oh, ok. i'm just always afraid                            that people think i'm just fat with big breasts. 
ross| no, no, i knew .|ross| she brought them up!                             i didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
erica| hey, well, in a couple of weeks                            i won't be able to travel.|monica| yeah, and i wanted her to                            get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
ross| hotel? why isn't she staying                            with you guys?|monica| because we're moving in a                            couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
erica| plus hotels are fun! my room                            has this little fridge full of free snacks!|ross| erica, those things aren't free.                            in fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any                            consumer product...
monica| ross! she's giving us her                            baby. she can eat you if she wants.|ross| oh man, i can't believe you                            guys are leaving this place.

monica| yeah, it takes two incomes.|ross| hey, is chandler here? we talked                            about catching a movie.
monica| oh, no. he doesn't have time                            for that. but if you want, you can go help him and joey                            pack up the guest room.|ross| mhm,  packing                            - sexy cheerleader comedy.

ross| rock on!|monica| well, i thought this would                            be a great opportunity to use up all the food that i                            don't want to move to the new house with me! so, enjoy:                            smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust,                            kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a                            questionable orange.

rachel| i'm gonna miss you so much.|phoebe| i know.
rachel| you know what? uhm, i have                            some goodbye stuff that i wanted to say to each of you                            and i was gonna save it until the end of the night,                            but come here .|ross| hey, what do you think they're                            doing in there?
joey| huh, if i had to guess i'd say                            rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and phoebe is doing                            the punching.|rachel| oh, pheebs, i don't even know                            where to start.
phoebe| ok well, before you do, i                            know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,                             but i do have                            something for you.|rachel| oh, oh. .                            what is this?
phoebe| it's a cotton swab with a                            bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the                            cloning process while you are over there, you can use                            the dna to create your own pheebs!|rachel| i'm gonna throw this away,                            but thank you so much for the gesture! 
monica| chandler? i was just in our                            bedroom and i found these                             on my pillow.|chandler| oh, yes. i decided to leave                            these out for you in case richard stops by and you wanna                            engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!                          
monica| what are you talking about?                            these aren't mine.|chandler| oh yeah, right! good luck                            getting another scarf dance from me!
monica| that would be a terrible                            punishment. but, i'm serious, i've never seen these                            before.|chandler| really? then what are they                            doing in our guestroom?
monica| rachel used to live in that                            room.|chandler| rachel... with handcuffs!                            interesting!

phoebe|  are you wearing                            waterproof mascara?|monica| no.
phoebe| oh, you're so screwed. |ross|  hey. what was that                            all about?
phoebe| she's gonna say goodbye to                            each of us individually.|ross| are you kidding? oh my god...
phoebe| yeah, i know, it's gonna be                            even worse for you... god... ross, get ready to do some                            serious crying.|ross| oh, man, i'm not going to be                            able to handle this.  now i know how my students                            feel at the end of each year. and why they act out by                            giving me such bad evaluations.
rachel| mon... okay... i've gotta...                            just say what it is i'm gonna say... none of the amazing                            things that have happened to me in the last ten years,                            would have happened if it wasn't for you. no-one has                            been more like a sister to me...|monica| i know what you mean. you're                            like a sister to me too. 
rachel|  i wouldn't know what i'm gonna do                            without you... |monica|                             you're the best friend i ever had.
rachel| |monica| what? 
rachel| i... i... i... |monica| that is so sweet. 
ross|  oh no, she took down                            monica... and i'm the crier in the family. oh god! i                            could be next. maybe she won't talk with me if it looks                            like we're deep in converstation. oh, so that thing                            you said about the thing. it really made me think about                            that other thing.|chandler| uh, rach?
ross| well it's okay. chandler is                            talking to her. |joey| i really made you think about                            that thing uh?
chandler| |rachel|  oh, i'm sure gonna                            miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i                            don't get.
chandler| no, no, no... they're really                            yours. we... found them in your old room.|rachel| well, these aren't mine. maybe                            monica used to use them with...
chandler| don't say richard! well,                            if they're not monica's and they're not yours, then                            whose are they?|rachel| well, i think you're forgetting                            the kinkiest former resident of that room.
chandler| pheebs!|phoebe|  yeah!
chandler| i think these are yours.|phoebe| these are not mine... look                            how flimsy they are, come on! good god! you try to hang                            a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like                            a piece of licorice.
rachel|  can i talk to                            you alone for a minute?|chandler| sure.  you don't                            really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
phoebe| where do you think mike really                            is?  |rachel| oh honey... 
chandler| let me just say something...                            because once we get into this, i'm gonna get all uncomfortable                            and probably make some stupid joke... i just want to                            say that i... i love you... and, i'm gonna miss you.                            and i'm so sad that you're leaving.|rachel|  
chandler| ooh, not so tight...  i'm sorry, just give me                            one more chance.|rachel| okay. oh...
rachel| oh!|chandler| i'm sor... just go. just                            go. i can't, i can't. 
monica|  so, i guess you're                            next. you're ready?|ross| i don't think so. 
chandler| oh, you're definately not.                            i haven't cried like that in years.|monica| you cried yesterday at the                            six o'clock news.
chandler| that old woman was being                            scammed by her mechanic. |ross| god! i can't believe she saved                            me for last.  why are they                            taking so long? 
phoebe| i don't know. but, god, joey                            seems to be handling it suprisingly well.|all| no, no, no, no!
ross| okay, here we go...|rachel| oh...                             well...
ross| yeah...|rachel| i think i'm gonna take off.                                                      
ross| huh?|rachel| oh, you guys. this was an                            amazing night. thank you so much. i love you. good night.
ross| what? i don't get a goodbye?                          |joey|  lucky                            bastard!
ross| unbelievable. she says goodbye                            to everyone but me.|monica| well, maybe she thought that                            with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
ross| well, it needs to be plicit.|joey| all right, let's think about                            this. i mean, there's got to be an explanation. uh...                            did you do anything to make her mad? 
ross| no, i don't think so.|phoebe| you know, maybe she was just                            really spent from our talk. it was pretty intense.
monica| yeah. mine too.|chandler| mine was a humdinger 
ross| |phoebe| ross, if you're this upset,                            you should go and talk to her.
monica| and say what? \you owe                            me a goodbye\, i mean, he's got more pride than                            that.|ross| the hell i do!
ross| i don't get a goodbye?|rachel| what?
ross|                             everyone gets a goodbye but me? what have i got to do                            to get a goodbye, huh? be best friends with you? uh,                            go out with you? have a baby with you? oh wait a minute,                            wait a minute, i did all those things.|rachel| ross...
ross| oh no, maybe it's me,                            i'm just not giving you enough credit. uh,                            i mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five                            people. uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good...                            |monica| i hope ross isn't too upset.
joey| i'm sure he's not more bummed                            out than i am.|phoebe| tell me about it.
chandler| well, you can't say we don't                            know how to throw a party.|phoebe| all right, i think i'm gonna                            head out.
monica| uh, where do you think you're                            going?|phoebe| i thought i was going home                            to go to bed, but i'm sensing there's something less                            fun for me to do here.
monica| we're moving in a couple of                            days and we've got a lot of packing to do. it would                            be great if you guys could pitch in.|chandler| joey and i can finish up                            in the guest room.
joey| oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. |monica| oh no! you and phoebe are                            gonna help me in here.
chandler| |monica| okay, we're gonna start in                            the kitchen. plates get put into plate protectors and                            stacked ten to a box. the silverware gets bundled in                            rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. got it?
phoebe and joey| yeah.|monica| good! now i need you to be                            careful and efficient. and remember, if i am harsh with                            you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
chandler| hey mon, i think i figured                            out whose handcuffs they are.|monica| you did? how?
chandler| well, i was cleaning out                            the closet and i found some pictures of them... being                            used.|monica| oh my god! let me see. 
joey| who's that dirty old lady?|chandler| monica's grandmother.
monica| nana liked it rough!|erica| hi!
all| hey!|joey| come on here, have a seat.
phoebe| how was your night?|erica| oh, it was okay. i went to                            a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. we went                            to this place that had... ooh...  hoo... ooh... anyway,                            they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.
monica| erica, are you okay?|erica| yeah, you know, maybe i ate                            too much. i keep getting these stomach aches. they come                            and go like every few minutes.
monica| oh my god!|chandler| relax! we just get her some                            antacids.
monica| she doesn't have a stomach                            ache, she's in labor.|chandler| oh my god!
phoebe| yeah, you got to get to the                            hospital.|monica| all right, chandler get the                            coats. erica let's go. phoebe and joey, keep packing!                            oh my god we're gonna have a baby. all right. we're                            gonna have a baby! oh my god, we're gonna have a baby!                            oh god, oh god, i got to sit down, i got to sit down.                            ooh! 
chandler| honey, it's gonna be okay.|erica| you can do this. just breathe.
monica| okay, okay... okay, i feel                            a little better.|erica|  ooh! are you sure?
monica| oh... yes, i'm sure. oh honey,                            let's go. okay bye everyone.|joey| chandler, wait, wait, wait...
chandler| what?|joey| if you get a second, find out                            where she got that cheeseburger.
rachel| you really think i didn't                            say goodbye to you because i don't care?|ross| that's what it seemed like.
rachel| i cannot believe that after                            ten years, you do not know one thing about me.|ross| fine, then why didn't you say                            something?
rachel| because it is too damn hard                            ross. i can't even begin to explain to you                            how much i'm gonna miss you. when i think about not                            seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go...                            okay, so if you think that i didn't say goodbye to you                            because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else,                            you're wrong. it's because you mean more to me. so there,                            all right, there's your goodbye... oh!|ross| rach!
rachel| what?|ross| you keep, you keep... you can't...
rachel| what?|joey| a little more.
phoebe| okay. |joey| a little more, a little more.                             a little more...                            all right. okay, all right, let's do this.
phoebe| all right, ready?|joey| yeah. all right, now give me                            your best shot.
phoebe| all right, here it goes...|joey| 
monica| erica, are you okay?|erica| yeah, you know, maybe i ate too much. i keep getting these    stomach-aches. they come and go like every few minutes.
monica| oh my god!|chandler| relax! we'll just get her some antacids.
monica| she doesn't have a stomach-ache. she's in labor!|chandler| oh my god!
rachel| so if you think i didn't say goodbye to you because you don't    mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. it's because you    mean more to me.|ross| rach!
rachel| what?!|ross| hey.
rachel| shh.. go back to sleep. i have to go home.|ross| oh. this was amazing.
rachel| it really was. you've learned some new moves!|ross| yeah, well, this guy at work gave me \sex for dummies\ as a    joke.
rachel| ah.|ross| who's laughing now?
rachel| i know!|monica| breathe, breathe, breathe... good.
chandler| next time, can i say breathe?|monica| no, last time you said it like dracula, and it scared her! can    i get you anything? you want some more ice chips?
erica| no, i'm okay.|monica| alright, i'll be right back.
chandler| where are you going?|monica| to use the bathroom.
chandler| you can't leave me alone with her.|monica| what?
chandler| this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not    comfortable with!|monica| what kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
chandler| it's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone    together.|monica| you'll be fine. nah, you won't, but i'll be back in two    minutes.
chandler| okay.|chandler| so, ah... any plans for the summer?
erica| i don't know. maybe church-camp?|chandler| hah. may not wanna mention this. so, you ever wonder which    is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
erica| what?|chandler| well, it's just interesting. you know, because no one will    ever know, because no one can experience both.
chandler| one of life's great, unanswerable questions. i mean, who    knows? maybe there's something even more painful than those things?  like this.|phoebe| morning.
joey| hey!|phoebe| what's that?
joey| it's my house-warming present for monica and chandler.|phoebe| it's a baby chick and duck!
joey| uh-huh. and i named them chick jr. and duck jr.|phoebe| i did not see that coming.
joey| yeah, i figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? it    has that big backyard. and then, when they get old, they can go to    that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to.|phoebe| yes.
joey| yeah. it's a shame people can't visit there.|phoebe| that is the rule, though.
phoebe| guess what? you're almost an uncle!|ross| what?
joey| yeah, erica went into labor last night. monica and chandler are    at the hospital right now!|ross| oh my god!
phoebe| yeah, and i have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.|ross| phoebe, you were sure ben was gonna be a girl.
phoebe| have you seen him throw a ball?|ross| is rachel here?
joey| uh, i think she's still asleep. hey, hey, how did it go with you    guys last night? she seemed pretty pissed at you.|ross| uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
phoebe| what's that smile? did something happen with you two?|ross| hey, i'm not one to kiss and tell, but i'm also not one to have    sex and shut up. we totally did it!
joey| oh my god. you and rachel?|ross| i know, it's pretty great.
joey| so what does that mean? are you guys getting back together?|ross| oh, i.. i don't know. we didn't really get to talk.
phoebe| but do you wanna get back together?|ross| i don't know. it was incredible. i mean, it just felt so right.    when i was holding her, i mean, i never wanted to let her go. you know    what? yeah, i do. i wanna be together.
phoebe|  yay!|ross| shhh!
phoebe|  yay!|joey| so, so is she still going to paris?
ross| wow, i hadn't thought of that. i hope not.|phoebe| oh, this is like the best day ever. ever! you guys might get    back together, monica and chandler are getting their baby, there are    chicks and ducks in the world again! oh, i feel like i'm in a musical!     \daa - raa... when the sun comes up, bright and beaming! and    the moon comes...\
rachel| morning!|phoebe| guess we'll never know how it ends.
joey| okay.|ross| hey.
rachel| hey.|ross| hey. how did you sleep?
rachel| good. you?|ross| good.
joey| i bet you did!|ross| uh. would you guys mind giving us a minute?
joey| sure, yeah. will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?|rachel| chick and the duck? didn't they die...
phoebe|  dive. yeah, they dove head-first into fun on    the farm.|ross| so...
ross| morning.|rachel| you too. last night was just wonderful.
ross| it really was.|rachel| i woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
ross| i know, me too. it was... you know, it was like one of those    things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's    everything you want it to be.|rachel| uh-huh. i know. it was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. 
monica| it's just a little bit more, honey.|erica| help me! this hurts!
chandler| is it really that bad?|erica| uh-huh! i think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which    is worse!
doctor| the baby's head is crowning.|monica| oh! oh my god! that is the most beautiful top of a head i have    ever seen! chandler, you have to see this!
chandler| i'm okay.|monica| chandler, you don't wanna miss this. this is the birth of your    child! it's the miracle of life!
chandler| alright. wow, that is one disgusting miracle.|doctor| start pushing. here we go. here come the shoulders...
monica| it's a... it's a boy!|chandler| wow!
erica| is he okay?|doctor| he's just fine.
monica| oh, you did it!|chandler|  it's a baby! a beautiful little baby! and some   other stuff i'm gonna pretend i don't see.
doctor| would you like to cut the umbilical cord?|chandler| well, that's spongy.
monica|  oh, we are so lucky!|chandler| i know. he has your eyes.
chandler| i mean, i know that's not possible, but he does.|nurse| we'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
chandler| okay.|monica|  oh my god, he's beautiful. thank you so much.
erica| i'm really happy for you guys.|chandler| how do you feel?
erica| i'm tired!|doctor| well, you don't have that much time to relax. the other one    will be along in a minute.
monica| i... i'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?|doctor| the next baby should be along in a minute.
monica| we only ordered one!|doctor| you know it's twins, right?
chandler| oh, yeah! these are the faces of two people in the know!|doctor| i can't believe you didn't know it's twins! this has never    happened before.
chandler| well, gosh. that makes me feel so special and good.|monica|  wait, did you know it was twins?
doctor| yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in    ohio.|monica|  anybody tell you?
erica| i don't think so. although, they did mention something about    two heartbeats. but i thought that was just mine and the baby's. they    kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and i thought well,    that's good 'cause i'm having a baby.|monica| this is unbelievable.
erica| twins actually run in my family.|chandler| interesting!  can i see you for a second?
chandler| what do we do?|monica| what do you mean \what do we do\?
chandler|  twins! twins!!|monica| chandler, you're panicking!
chandler| uh-huh! join me, won't you?! okay, what do you say we keep   one, and then just like have an option on the other one?|monica| we can't split them up!
chandler| why not? we could give each of them half a medallion, and    then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. i mean,    that's a great day for everybody.|monica| okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
chandler| what if they're not? what if it's adopted by a king?|monica| yeah, because i hear the king is looking to adopt.
chandler| monica, we are not ready to have two babies!|monica| that doesn't matter! we have waited so long for this. i don't    care if it's two babies. i don't care if it's three babies! i don't    care if the entire cast of \eight is enough\ comes out of there! we    are taking them home, because they are our children!
chandler|  okay. shhh...|chandler| okay.
monica| okay!|chandler| okay!
doctor| it looks like we're about ready over here.|doctor| come on, erica, start pushing again now.
erica| ow!|doctor| here she comes!
chandler|  she? it's a girl?|doctor| yeah.
chandler|     and that's enough!|ross| and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
joey| oh my god! what did you say?|ross| nothing! what do you say to that?
phoebe| ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!|ross| no way!
joey| you can't just give up! is that what a dinosaur would do?|ross| what?
joey| dude, i'm just trying to speak your language.|phoebe| ross, rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. if    she did, she might feel differently. she might not even go.
ross| you really think so?|phoebe| i'm telling you! oh, okay! this is the part of the musical    where there'd be a really good convincing song.  \bam-bam,    don't take no for an answer. bam-bam, don't let love fly away.    bam-bam-bam-bam...\
rachel| hi!|phoebe| can't a girl finish a song around here?
joey| hey!|rachel| hi! so i just dropped emma off at my mom's.
ross| okay.|joey| oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
rachel| no, we decided that i would go ahead and set up first, and    then my mom would bring emma to paris on sunday.|phoebe| wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? good luck, mom.
rachel| are you kidding? eight hours with my mother talking about    atkins? good luck, emma!|ross| alright, you know what? you're right. i should at least tell her   how i feel.
joey| ross, wait!|ross| what? what?
joey| could you get me a muffin?|gunther| rachel?
rachel| yeah?|gunther| i... i know you're leaving tonight, but i just have to tell   you. i love you.
gunther| i... i don't know if that changes your plans at all, but i   thought you should know.|rachel|  gunther... oh... i love you too. probably not in the   same way, but i do. and, and when i'm in a caf, having coffee, or i   see a man with hair brighter than the sun, i'll think of you. aw.
rachel| oh... bye guys.|ross| oh my god!
phoebe| unbelievable!|joey| hey, you know what might help?
ross| i'm not getting you a muffin!|monica| do you think they recognize each other from in there?
chandler| maybe. unless they're like two people who have lived in    apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're    pushed through a vagina and they meet.|nurse| we're going to take erica to recovery now.
monica| there's something that we wanna tell you. we decided to name    the girl-baby erica.|erica| oh my god, that's just like my name!
monica| son of a gun, it is!|erica| anyway, i'm gonna go and get some rest. i'm really glad i    picked you guys. you're gonna make great parents. even chandler.
monica| okay, well, bye!|erica| bye!
chandler| bye!|monica| we'll call you!
erica| okay.|chandler| have fun at church-camp!
monica| oh, look at these little bunnies!|chandler| i know! you ready to trade?
monica| okay.|chandler| okay.
monica| alright, let's see..|chandler| we could trade later.
monica| yeah, i'm good.|phoebe| hey, what are you working on?
joey| it's a... it's a \welcome home\ sign for the baby.|phoebe| how sweet! oh, is that the baby?
joey| no, i sat in the paint.|ross| hey.
phoebe| hey. so, did you talk to rachel?|ross| no, and i'm not going to.
phoebe| what?|joey| why not?
ross| because she's just going to shoot me down. you guys saw what    happened with gunther. that did not look like fun.|phoebe| how can you compare yourself to gunther? i mean, sure, he's    sexy in a more obvious way. you have a relationship with her, you    slept together last night.
ross| yeah, and she still wants to go! it's pretty clear where she is.|joey| yeah, i know what you mean. i mean, sometimes...
phoebe| uh, joe?|joey| damn it!
ross| look, even if i were gonna tell her, i don't have to do it now.    okay? i'll be seeing her again. we've got time.|phoebe| no, you don't! she's going to paris! she is going to meet    somebody. do you know how many hot guys there are in paris? it's...    it's a city of gunthers!
mike| hey!|phoebe| hey! what do you have there?
mike| oh, i made a little something. if i had more time to work on it,    it'd be better, but..|ross| oh my god! you did that yourself?
phoebe| honey, that's gorgeous!|joey| you know, the baby can't read, mike!
rachel| hi! you guys, the car-service just got here. i can't believe   they're not home yet! i have to catch my stupid plane. i wanna see the   baby!|joey| monica just called from the cab. she said they should be here   any minute. and apparently, there's some big surprise.
phoebe| yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'cause my friend ethel's   baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|rachel| oh my god!
ross| oh my god!|rachel| hi! oh my gosh!
chandler| hey.|joey|  hey, so what is the big surprise?
rachel| oh.|ross| oh my god!
rachel| what... what...|ross| okay, okay, awkward question. the hospital knows you took two,    right?
monica| yes, it's twins!|ross| oh my god.
joey| oh, they're so cute! now, what, what kinds are they?|monica|  and that's a girl.
chandler| her name is erica.|rachel| aw..
joey| hey, that pregnant girl's name was erica.|chandler| yeah. it's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time   together.
monica| yeah, we named the boy jack after dad.|ross| aw, he's gonna be so happy.
phoebe| oh, jack bing. i love that. ooh, it sounds like a '40s   newspaper guy, you know? \jack bing, morning gazette. i'm gonna blow   this story wide open!\|rachel| oh my gosh. wow, so beautiful.
mike|  i want one.|phoebe| oh yeah? well, tell me which one, and i'll try slip it in my   coat.
mike| seriously. wanna make one of those?|phoebe| one? how about a whole bunch?
mike| really?|phoebe| yeah! ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the   von trapp family! only without the nazis. although that sounds kinda   dull.
rachel| oh, you guys, i can't believe this. but i'll leave now, or i'm   gonna miss my plane.|monica| i'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
rachel| me too. oh, i'm just sorry i'm not gonna be around to watch   you two attempt to handle this! alright, i can't say goodbye to you   guys again. i love you all so much.|monica| i love you.
chandler| i love you.|monica| call us when you get there.
rachel| i will. ross, come here.|rachel| i just want you to know.. last night.. i'll never forget it.
ross| neither will i.|rachel| alright, now i really have to go. okay. au revoir! oh, they're    gonna really hate me over there.
phoebe| so, you just let her go?|ross| yeah.
joey| hey, maybe that's for the best.|ross| yeah?
joey| yeah. you know? you just... look, you gotta... you gotta think    about last night the way she does, okay? maybe, maybe sleeping    together was the perfect way to say goodbye?|phoebe| but now she'll never know how he feels!
joey| maybe that's okay. you know? maybe, maybe it is better this way?    i mean, now, now you can move on. i mean, you've been trying to for so   long, maybe now that you're on different continents..  right?|joey| maybe now you can actually do it. you know? you can finally get   over her.
ross| yeah, that's true. except i don't wanna get over her.|joey| what?
ross| i don't! i wanna be with her.|joey| really?
ross| yeah, i'm gonna go after her.|joey| yeah, you are!
phoebe| woo!|phoebe| wait, wait! get your coat! get your coat!
ross| my coat...|joey| this is so cool!
chandler| i have no idea what's going on, but i am excited!|joey| but ross, ross. what do you, what do you think she's going to   say?
ross| i don't know, but i.. look, even if she shoots me down, at least   i won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened.   where - where is my coat?!|phoebe| you didn't bring one! my cab's downstairs, i'll drive you to   the airport.
ross| okay, guys, wish me luck.|phoebe| hurry!
joey| good luck, good luck!|ross| there's no seatbelt!
phoebe| that's okay. if - if we hit anything, the engine will explode,    so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.|ross| alright, alright, let's do this!
phoebe| okay!|ross| hey!
man| 18th and east end.|phoebe| i - i don't take passengers.
man| hey! the law says you have to accept any fare.|ross| no, you don't understand. this isn't a real cab.
man| alright, i gotta report you. what's your medallion number?|phoebe| my medallion number is, \get out of the cab!\
man| what?|ross|  get out of the cab!
phoebe| get out of the cab!|joey| oh, hey, hey, can i give you guys your house-warming present    now?
monica| now, that you can do.|joey| alright!
joey| ah... chick jr.? duck jr.? don't hide from mama!|phoebe| you can open your eyes now.
ross| are we off the bridge?|phoebe| yes.
ross| is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?|phoebe| yes, she jumped right back up.
ross| oh my god, phoebe, slow down!|phoebe| do you wanna get to rachel in time?
ross| yes, but i don't wanna die in your cab!|phoebe| you should have thought of that before you got in!
phoebe| toll-booth.|ross| what?
phoebe|  toll-booth! four bucks. there are quarters in the    glove compartment.|phoebe| hurry!
ross| okay!|phoebe| okay.
phoebe| damn, that window is clean.|joey| quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack,   quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...
chandler| we were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but   now we understand you were doing this.|joey| okay, i wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift,   i got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
chandler| really? you got us a chick and a duck?|monica| oh, great! just what you want for a new house with infants.   bird feces.
joey| yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now   they're gone!|chandler| oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
monica| actually, i'm gonna go check on the twins.|chandler| alright.
monica| oh god! what did i just step on?|joey| oh!
chandler| it's okay, it's just an egg roll.|monica| oh..
joey| you stepped on my egg roll?|monica| i'm sorry, i didn't know to look for chinese food on the    floor.
joey| just put it on a plate and leave.|chandler| okay, let's find these birds.
joey| alright.|joey| wait, wait. do you hear that?
joey| oh! they're in the table!|chandler| well, that can't be good!
joey| we gotta get them out of there!|chandler| how?
joey| oh, oh! maybe we can lure them out. you know any birdcalls?|chandler| oh, tons, i'm quite the woodsman.
joey| well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.|chandler| joey, wait! the ball!
joey| oh!|joey| oh god! so what do we do?
chandler| i don't know. maybe we can open this up somehow.|joey| okay.
chandler| no... it's all glued together.|joey| does that mean we have to bust it open?
chandler| i don't know. maybe.|joey| oh my god!
chandler| i know! it's.. it's the foosball table.|joey| all right, you know what? we don't have a choice. it's like i would    have said in that sci-fi movie if i'd gotten the part. \those are our    men in there, we have to get them out! even if i have to sacrifice the    most important thing in my life; my time-machine.\
chandler| did that movie ever get made?|joey| it did not.
phoebe| ross, where are you going?|ross| to talk to rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the    death-cab?
phoebe| what? what are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? have    you never chased anyone through the airport before?|ross| not since my cop-show got cancelled.
phoebe| you have to get a ticket to get past security.|ross| what? we're never gonna make it!
phoebe| not with that attitude! now, haul ass!|ross| okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great. 
rachel| oh my god! i was so afraid i wasn't gonna remember any of my    high-school french, but i understood every word you just said!|rachel| oh.
rachel| oh, shoot. i had it. oh, i can't believe this.|rachel| i have it, i have it, i have it. oh, okay, i can't find it,    but i remember that i was in seat 32c, because that's my bra-size.
rachel| okay, fine! but you know what? if i was in 36d, we would not  be having this problem. |ross| hey, i need a ticket.
phoebe| just one? i drive you all the way down here, and i don't get    to see how it works out?|ross| fine, two tickets, i need two tickets.
phoebe| we're on our honeymoon.|ticket agent| and the destination?
ross| i don't care. whatever is the cheapest.|phoebe| i'm so lucky i married you.
rachel| oh! shoot! damn it! where is it? oh! oh! i found it! i found    it!|rachel| hah! i found it! i told you i would find it! in your face!  you're a different person. 
ross| okay, flight 421 to paris. i don't see it, do you see it?|phoebe| no, did we miss it?
ross| no, no, no. that's impossible. it doesn't leave for another 20    minutes.|phoebe| maybe we have the flight-number wrong. god.

chandler| and we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.|joey| okay. here goes.
chandler| what's the matter?|joey| i need to say goodbye to the table first.
chandler| i understand.|joey| okay. table, you have given us so many great times. and you    guys, jordan, victor, joel... all of you guys. what can i say? you    guys make us look good. you wanna say anything?
chandler| i don't know. except that, for one last time...  good game, good game, good game,    good game, good game, good game, good game.|joey| okay, here we go. i can't do it.
chandler| well, i can't do it either.|monica| hey! did you find them?
joey| yeah, they're stuck inside the table!|chandler| we have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
monica| oh, well sure. this gotta be so hard. i'll do it. gimme!|ross| phoebe! wow! no, no, no!
phoebe| well, i've never gone this fast before.|ross| phoebe, forget it, okay? newark is - is like an hour away.    there's no way we're gonna make it in time.
phoebe| she's got her cell, you could call her.|ross| i am not doing this over the phone.
phoebe| you don't have any other choice!|rachel| hello?
phoebe| rachel? oh, good. hey, by the way, did you just get on the    plane?|rachel| yeah.
phoebe|  for what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.|ross| yay.
phoebe| uh, rach, hang on.|rachel| phoebe? is everything okay?
phoebe| uhm, actually no. no, you've... you have to get off the plane.|rachel| what? why?
phoebe| i have this feeling that something's wrong with it. something    is wrong with the left philange.|rachel| oh, honey, i'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
rachel| alright, look, i have to go. i love you, and i will call you    the minute i get to paris.|rachel| oh, that was just my crazy friend. she told me i should get    off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something    wrong with the left philange.
rachel| i wouldn't worry about it. she's always coming up with stuff    like this, and you know what? she's almost never right.|rachel| well...
rachel| wait, what are you doing?|air stewardess| excuse me, sir, where are you going?
rachel| could i get some peanuts?|air stewardess| there's nothing wrong with the plane.
air stewardess| there is no philange!|air stewardess| ma'am, please sit down!
rachel| this is ridiculous! i...|rachel| yeah, okay.
monica| alright. my job here is done.|chandler| that was... impressive.
joey| yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!|monica| yeah, they were just slowing me down. alright, i have to get    back to the babies. i'll see you girls later.
chandler| sorry about the table, man.|joey| yeah.
chandler| you gonna buy a new one?|joey| probably not. nah. i don't know how much i'm gonna wanna play    after you go.
chandler| well, at least we got these little guys out.|joey| yeah.
chandler| aww, we were worried about you! hm. i guess i better get    used to things crapping in my hand, huh?|joey| i'm gonna miss these little guys. it was nice having birds    around again.
chandler| hey, you know what? maybe we should keep them here with you.|joey| what?
chandler| yeah, i mean we've got a lot going on right now. and, plus,    here they'd have their own room.|joey| i could get a goose!
chandler| you know, i - i think you're set with the poultry.|joey| thanks man. did you hear that, you guys? you're gonna get to    stay here! and, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a    reason to come visit.
chandler| i think there may be another reason. so, awkward hug or lame    cool guy handshake?|joey| uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
ross| where is she?|phoebe| i don't see her.

monica| well, that's it. everything's packed.|chandler| wow, this is weird.

chandler| where's ross?|phoebe| he went home. he didn't want to see anybody.
rachel|  ross, hi. it's me. i just got back    on the plane. and i just feel awful. that is so not how i wanted    things to end with us. it's just that i wasn't expecting to see you,    and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... and... and    now i'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff i should have    said, and i didn't. i mean, i didn't even get to tell you that i love    you too. because of course i do. i love you. i love you. i love you.    what am i doing? i love you! oh, i've gotta see you. i've gotta get    off this plane.|ross| oh my god!

rachel|  oh, please, miss, you don't    understand!|ross| try to understand!
rachel|  oh, come on, miss, isn't there any    way that you can just let me off...|ross| no! no! oh my god. did she get off the plane? did she get off    the plane?
rachel| i got off the plane.|ross| you got off the plane.

ross| don't make jokes now.|monica| okay, please be careful with that. it was my grandmother's. be    careful.
monica| if that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.|ross| wow.
rachel| i know. it seems smaller somehow.|joey| has it always been purple?
chandler|  look around, you guys. this was your first    home. and it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. but    more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!|phoebe| hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived    in this apartment?
monica| oh, yeah, that's true.|ross| uh, i haven't.
monica| wait a minute. what about that summer during college that you    lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?|ross| do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming    up?
monica| oh, honey, i forgot. i promised treeger that we'd leave our    keys.|chandler| oh, okay.
phoebe| so, i guess this is it.|joey| yeah. i guess so.
monica|  this is harder than i thought it would be.|chandler| oh, it's gonna be okay.
